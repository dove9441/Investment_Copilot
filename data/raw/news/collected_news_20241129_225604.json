      "full_content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump declared a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico on Wednesday after talking with that country’s leader. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.\n\nThe two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.\n\nTrump said Sheinbaum “agreed to stop Migration through Mexico.” Sheinbaum indicated separately on social media that she told Trump that Mexico is already “taking care of” migrant caravans, calling it an “excellent conversation.”\n\n“We reiterate that Mexico’s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,” Sheinbaum added.\n\nWhile the state of the proposed tariffs remained unclear, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social account that this was “effectively closing our Southern Border.” He called it a “very productive conversation.”\n\nThe exchange between the two leaders appeared to confirm for Trump the value of threatening to disrupt trade with import taxes. His initial social media post moved financial markets and gave him a response he was quick to describe as a win. Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump can tell supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool and continue to rely on tariff threats.\n\nSheinbaum wrote on social media that the leaders “discussed Mexico’s strategy on migration issues, and I told him the caravans are not reaching the northern (U.S.) border, because Mexico is taking care of them.”\n\nWhat to know about Trump’s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n“We also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption,” she said.\n\nIllegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico — the sort Trump seems to be celebrating.\n\nArrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high in December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.\n\nDriven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to rounding them up across the country and sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.\n\nNeither side clarified the status of the tariffs. But their implementation could fuel higher prices and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump’s previous time in the White House.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20. He also proposed an additional 10% tariff on China tied to its exporting of materials used in the production of fentanyl.\n\nIn announcing his plans, he railed against the flow of fentanyl and migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump also posted that he plans a large scale ad campaign to explain “how bad Fentanyl is for people to use,” predicting it would educate people on “how really bad the horror of this Drug is.”\n\nThe dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.\n\nThrough September, the United States has imported $378.9 billion in goods from Mexico, $322.2 billion from China and $309.3 billion from Canada.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report."

      "full_content": "An ASML icon is being displayed on a circuit board, alongside the flags of the USA and China, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on January 4, 2024.\n\nBloomberg reported on Wednesday that Washington is considering further measures to restrict sales of semiconductor equipment and AI memory chips to China, but that the new rules could stop short of earlier proposals that were seen as stricter.\n\nASML was around 2.9% higher in afternoon trade in Europe. Tokyo Electron closed 6.7% higher in Japan where it trades.\n\nShares of key global semiconductor equipment firms jumped on Thursday after a report that the U.S. is considering sanctions on China's chip industry that stop short of earlier proposals.\n\nThe U.S. is now considering adding fewer suppliers to Chinese technology giant Huawei to an export blacklist known as the Entity List. According to the report, one key Chinese firm that won't be added is ChangXin Memory Technologies, a memory company and potential rival to the likes of SK Hynix and Samsung.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies said ASML had previously guided toward a 30% decline in its revenue from China next year. The exclusion of that company could mean that ASML's sales in China \"decline by less than expected next year,\" Jefferies said Thursday.\n\nASML has been caught in the crosshairs of the U.S. and China's technology battle over semiconductors because of the Dutch firm's critical position in the chip supply chain.\n\nASML produces a machine that chipmakers require to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors. Those machines have not yet been exported to China due to various export controls. More recently, the Dutch and U.S. governments have imposed restrictions that make it more difficult for ASML to export some of its less advanced machines to China.\n\nThe company sells its machines to \"fabs\" or plants that actually manufacture chips such as Taiwan's TSMC as well as SMIC in China. Any rules that hit demand or directly target semiconductor manufacturers will have a negative impact on ASML.\n\nThe Bloomberg report suggested that further sanctions under consideration would target Chinese firms making semiconductor manufacturing equipment, rather than the factories that actually make the chips. This is also a positive for ASML and other foreign semiconductor equipment firms that sell to fabs."

      "full_content": "Putin threatens Kyiv decision-makers after striking energy grid\n\nGetty Images People hid in a Kyiv subway during Russia's latest attack\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to attack decision-making centres in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv with the country's new ballistic missile, Oreshnik. Putin was speaking hours after Russia launched a “comprehensive” strike on Ukraine’s energy grid overnight, in what he called a response to \"continued attacks\" using US-supplied Atacms missiles on Russian soil. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that any \"Russian blackmail\" would be met with a \"tough response\". Ukraine used Atacms and UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike inside Russian territory last week for the first time since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, following approval by the Western suppliers, the US, the UK and France.\n\nThe overnight Russian strike unfolded over several hours with waves of drones and missiles flying across the length and breadth of Ukraine - the second attack of its kind this month. There were no fatalities, but it left more than one million people in Ukraine without power. Zelensky said cluster munitions had been used against civilian and energy infrastructure. \"Cluster warheads [are] a particularly dangerous type of Russian weaponry used against civilians,\" he said, adding that they \"significantly complicated\" the work of rescuers and repair crews.\n\nPutin said the Russia attack involving 90 missiles and 100 drones also included the \"Oreshnik\" - a new ballistic missile which, according to Putin, cannot be intercepted. US officials believe Russia is likely only to have a small number of the experimental Oreshnik missiles and would need time to produce more of them. Responding in his nightly address, Zelensky said Putin \"has no interest in ending this war\" and sought to \"prevent others from ending this war\". \"[His] escalation now is a form of pressure aimed at eventually forcing the president of the United States to accept Russia's terms.\" The Russian leader also said Moscow would not allow Ukraine to get nuclear weapons, and if it ever did, would use \"all means of destruction at Russia's disposal\", according to Russia's state-run news agency RIA. This is thought to be a reference to reports in the New York Times newspaper last week that unnamed Western officials had suggested giving Ukraine nuclear weapons before US President Joe Biden leaves office in January. Zelensky has also repeatedly complained that the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, by which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons inherited from the USSR, had left the country without the necessary security.\n\nReuters While there were no fatalities, many people's homes were damaged in the attack, including in Odesa\n\nThe Russian attacks caused explosions in several cities, including Odesa, Kharkiv and Lutsk. Kyiv was also the target of attacks, but Ukrainian authorities say all missiles targeting the capital were intercepted. Kyiv's military administration said the attack lasted almost nine-and-a-half hours. At least 12 areas across Ukraine, including three western regions, were hit and Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said emergency power outages had been introduced.\n\nElsewhere, the head of the Rivne administration Oleksandr Koval said electricity supplies had been cut to more than 280,000 people in the western region. In the Lviv region, as many as 523,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, according to regional head Maksym Kozytsky. In Kherson, authorities said they could be left without electricity for days. Ukrainian authorities have responded by implementing pre-emptive emergency power cuts in order to minimise damaging overloads to the country’s grid. Temperatures are dropping and the country has already experienced its first snowfalls, but the full force of Ukraine’s famously harsh winter has not yet been felt. Ukrainian officials fear another concerted Russian attempt to deplete the power grid as winter arrives. They have been warning for some time that Russia has been stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles in order to launch coordinated and country-wide attacks on Ukraine’s energy system."

      "full_content": "Jim Abrahams, who arrived in Hollywood with two childhood buddies as a comedy-writing trio that found fame with deadpan parodies and a blitz of puns with “Airplane!” and the Naked Gun series, died Nov. 26 at his home in Santa Monica, California. He was 80. The death was announced by his family, but no cause was noted. Mr. Abrahams had been battling leukemia for two decades.\n\nMr. Abrahams built a wide-ranging résumé as a solo director including comedies such as “Big Business” (1988), starring Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin, and “Hot Shots!” (1991) and the 1993 “Hot Shots! Part Deux,” both starring Charlie Sheen in spoofs of action movies — first “Top Gun” and then “Rambo.”\n\nYet Mr. Abrahams delivered some of his biggest comedic punches alongside his longtime friends from Wisconsin, brothers Jerry and David Zucker. The team, collectively known as ZAZ, took mutual credit for all their ideas and for classic lines that became part of film comedy lore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Can you fly this plane and land it?” asked a somber Dr. Rumack, played by Leslie Nielsen in the 1980 aviation crisis parody “Airplane!”\n\n“Surely you can’t be serious,” replied a former military pilot (Robert Hays) who is still haunted by the war.\n\n“I am serious,” said a stone-faced Rumack, “and don’t call me Shirley.”\n\nMr. Abrahams and the Zucker brothers began to craft their comedic sensibilities in the early 1970s in Madison, Wisconsin, with their Kentucky Fried Theater — a mix of improv sketches and prerecorded satires of commercials, TV shows and pop culture.\n\n“There were a bunch of groups in that era who were making political jokes, and there were lots of easy, obvious targets,” Mr. Abrahams told the Hollywood Reporter. “But that was just never our instinct. Our instinct was always to watch a movie and say, ‘Isn’t that silly?'”\n\nThe troupe became the inspiration for the first ZAZ-written film, “The Kentucky Fried Movie” (1977), a sketch-filled pastiche directed by John Landis before he turned to 1978′s “Animal House.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir next pitch to Paramount Studios sought to wring humor from overwrought drama. They had come across the crisis-in-the-air movie “Zero Hour!” (1957), about a troubled former World War II pilot (Dana Andrews) who must take the controls of a commercial plane when the crew is stricken from eating a meal of bad fish. (The film was co-written by Arthur Hailey, who later found fame with a string of nail-biter novels including “Airport” in 1968.)\n\nFor Mr. Abrahams and his collaborators, “Zero Hour!” was perfect for parody and their brand of burlesque-style sight gags. They secured the rights. In the script, they used virtually the same name for their hero (Ted Stryker became Ted Striker), kept the exclamation point in the title and lifted some of the dialogue verbatim for its laugh-getting potential such as: “We need somebody who can not only fly this plane, but who didn’t have fish for dinner.”\n\n“That’s an actual line,” said Mr. Abrahams. “That was a line from ‘Zero Hour!’”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie was given the go-ahead by Michael Eisner, who was running Paramount at the time, but with a caveat. The studio reserved the right to replace the ZAZ team with an experienced director. A main studio worry was the insistence by Mr. Abrahams and the Zuckers that no big-name comedians have roles.\n\nInstead, the trio demanded mainstream actors such as Nielsen, Hays, Peter Graves as a jetliner captain, Julie Hagerty as a plucky flight attendant and Lloyd Bridges as an air traffic controller. (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar appears as a co-pilot who is hassled by a kid who knows he’s really a basketball star.) Mr. Abrahams told the studio: The more seriously the actors delivered their lines, the funnier they will be.\n\n“The biggest struggle was to cast straight actors as opposed to comedians,” he recalled in 2019. “At first, Paramount was resistant to that idea. They didn’t quite understand why we wanted to do something like that.”\n\nThe “don’t call me Shirley” scene was one of the first shot. Mr. Abrahams said the studio executives saw how Nielsen’s gruff retort elevated the joke. “They finally understood the concept and were much more comfortable dealing with us,” he said.\n\nThe film was a box office hit and was widely hailed as a worthy successor in the parody genre after director Mel Brooks in the 1970s took on westerns in “Blazing Saddles” and horror in “Young Frankenstein.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It is sophomoric, obvious, predictable, corny, and quite often very funny,” wrote film critic Roger Ebert in a 1980 review of “Airplane!” in the Chicago Sun-Times. “And the reason it’s funny is frequently because it’s sophomoric, predictable, corny, etc.”\n\nThe ZAZ team then turned to cop dramas, creating “Police Squad!” as a midseason show for ABC in 1982 that starred Nielsen as an earnest but bumbling detective. The show was canceled after six episodes but inspired the 1988 film “The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!”\n\nWritten by the ZAZ trio and directed by David Zucker, the movie brought Nielsen back in the detective role along with an eclectic ensemble that included O.J. Simpson, Priscilla Presley and actor George Kennedy. Two sequels followed: “The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear” (1991) and “The Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult” (1994).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Airport!” had a sequel, too. But it didn’t involve Mr. Abrahams or the Zucker brothers.\n\nThey had pursued an idea that the flight attendant Elaine Dickinson takes Striker to visit her family, which turns out to be the Corleone clan from “The Godfather.” The movie was envisioned as a mafia spoof called “Airplane II: The Godfather,” said Mr. Abrahams.\n\nThe “Godfather” director, Francis Ford Coppola, nixed the concept, and studio executives backed off. The ZAZ team called it quits, too.\n\nDirector Ken Finkleman took the reins for “Airplane II: The Sequel” (1982), which reunited much of the original cast as hero Ted Striker (Hays) saves a space shuttle full of passengers. The script was written by Finkleman, Al Jean and Mike Reiss.\n\n“We had … pretty much run out of airplane jokes,” said Mr. Abrahams in the 2023 book “Surely You Can’t Be Serious” by Mr. Abrahams and the Zucker brothers on the making of “Airplane!”\n\nWisconsin roots\n\nJames Steven Abrahams was born in Shorewood, Wisconsin, on May 10, 1944. His father was a lawyer, and his mother was a researcher on education-related topics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Abrahams met the Zucker brothers as a child, worshiping at the same synagogue. They all attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Mr. Abrahams graduated in 1966. (David Zucker graduated in 1970; Jerry in 1972.)\n\nThe Kentucky Fried Theater was founded in 1971, and they headed to Los Angeles after Jerry Zucker finished college. In Landis’s “The Kentucky Fried Movie,” Mr. Abrahams and the Zuckers played various roles in the sketches, and performers such as Donald Sutherland and Henry Gibson had cameos.\n\n“I remember making ‘The Kentucky Fried Movie’ and thinking, ‘Someday I’m going to get married. Someday I’m going to have kids. And someday I’m going to have to explain this to them,'” Abrahams once joked.\n\nThe ZAZ team’s other films include the Cold War romp “Top Secret!” (1984), starring Val Kilmer, and “Ruthless People” (1986), starring Midler and Danny DeVito.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a director, Mr. Abrahams’s credits include the teen drama “Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael” (1990), starring Winona Ryder, and the mobster spoof “Jane Austen’s Mafia!” (1998) with Jay Mohr and Christina Applegate.\n\nMr. Abrahams and Pat Proft (his co-writer on the “Hot Shots!” films) reunited with Craig Mazin on “Scary Movie 4” (2006), directed by David Zucker.\n\nMr. Abrahams married Nancy Cocuzzo in 1976. Other survivors include two sons, a daughter, two sisters and three grandchildren. One son, Charlie, had childhood seizures that later ended. In 1997, Mr. Abraham directed an ABC television movie, “First Do No Harm,” about a woman (Meryl Streep) whose son has epilepsy.\n\nMr. Abrahams often expressed astonishment that “Airplane!” still found an audience decades later. He credits some of that longevity to their decision to play the comedy straight with veteran actors."

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy intend to lean on two recent Supreme Court rulings that they argue will make it easier to tear up a multitude of federal regulations.\n\nThe duo, who President-elect Donald Trump named to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, point to the decisions in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2022 and in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo earlier this year, both of which limited federal agencies’ regulatory authority.\n\nHowever, multiple legal and regulatory experts told CNN that Musk and Ramaswamy are misinterpreting the decisions, which could actually make it harder to overturn existing rules.\n\n“These recent Supreme Court rulings won’t make their life easier in reducing the stock of existing regulations,” said James Broughel, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank that aims to reduce regulations. Decisions “like Loper Bright work against them,” he said.\n\nMajor rulings\n\nIn the Loper Bright ruling, the justices overturned long-standing judicial precedent that required courts to give deference to federal agencies’ rulemaking when a law is ambiguous, with the new decision meaning that courts will give more scrutiny to the regulatory moves the executive branch is making. In the West Virginia case, the Supreme Court cut back agencies’ power to address issues of major economic and political significance when Congress hasn’t explicitly given the agencies those authorities.\n\n“Together, these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority Congress has granted under the law,” Musk and Ramaswamy, who have many business ventures that would benefit from fewer regulations, wrote in a recent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. “DOGE will present this list of regulations to President Trump, who can, by executive action, immediately pause the enforcement of those regulations and initiate the process for review and rescission. This would liberate individuals and businesses from illicit regulations never passed by Congress and stimulate the U.S. economy.”\n\nBut there are several problems with the pair’s assertions, said Nicholas Bagley, an administrative law expert and University of Michigan Law School professor.\n\n“Those are cases that limit agency discretion,” he told CNN. “The cases add nothing to the executive branch’s power to reconsider old regulations.”\n\nPlus, federal departments would still have to follow the administrative process to overturn a rule – by issuing a new regulation in its place. The agencies would have to justify why they are changing the regulation and allow the public to comment on the proposed rule. The cumbersome effort would require significant agency resources, could take several years and would likely be subject to legal challenges after the new regulation was finalized.\n\n“It’s a very painstaking, very difficult process that’s likely to fail in most cases,” said Richard Pierce Jr., a George Washington University law professor who specializes in administrative law and government regulation.\n\nSlashing needed workers\n\nWhat’s more, the endeavor would require a lot of assistance from agency staffers – the very workers that Musk and Ramaswamy have promised to cut. The duo argue in the op-ed that a reduction in the number of federal workers should at least be “proportionate” to the number of regulations eliminated, adding that fewer employees would be needed to produce and enforce regulations in the future.\n\nThat could backfire, experts say.\n\n“These are the people that they’re going to need to review all these regulations,” Broughel said. “If they really want to make a major dent in the stock of regulations, they’re going to need people who have been working with these regulations day in and day out, and that’s the career civil service staff.”\n\nTrump also promised a massive rollback in regulations during his first term, but he was more successful in slowing the pace of new regulations rather than slashing a multitude of existing ones, Broughel said.\n\nDuring Trump’s first administration, the Council of Economic Advisers published a report in 2019 that said the president’s deregulatory actions would raise household income by $3,100 after five to 10 years. Also, it noted that the introduction of new regulations was being kept to a minimum.\n\nThere is, however, a way to eliminate some of the regulations recently implemented by the Biden administration. GOP lawmakers can use the Congressional Review Act to overturn rules enacted in the final months of President Joe Biden’s term, and those reversal measures are not subject to the Senate filibuster, meaning Republicans will only need 50 votes in the upper chamber to wipe those newly enacted Biden rules off the books. Roughly 100 rules could be eligible, according to a list compiled by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nBoth Musk, who owns X and is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, have reasons to want to slash regulations, which could interfere with their vast business portfolios. For instance, in a town hall on X last month, Musk repeatedly criticized government regulations, citing their interference with his companies.\n\n“It’s quite arduous getting regulatory approval,” Musk said while discussing his Neuralink startup that develops implantable brain-computer interfaces. “It does slow us down, and I think we should be able to go faster in the US with advancing Neuralink technology and other technologies that are out there unrelated to my company.”\n\nCNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

      "full_content": "Tens of millions will travel across the United States for the Thanksgiving holiday, many crisscrossing the country. As far as the weather is concerned, this looks to be a relatively tranquil week — with some exceptions for snow and rain. Much of the country will be beneath high pressure and sinking air, which will bring dry, cool weather. The exception will be in parts of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where a developing storm system is set to deliver coastal rains and inland snow. The system will march up the Appalachian Mountains on Thursday into Friday. Lake-effect snow will plaster areas including Upstate New York in its wake.\n\nWhen it comes to travel, storms are always a problem this time of year, so it’s important to do early research into dealing with delayed and canceled flights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor air travel, the best way to stay on top of your schedule is by downloading your airline’s mobile app and signing up to get notifications by phone, text, email or push alert. Those apps can alert you to gate changes and cancellations in real time, and they offer you an easy way to rebook flights instead of getting in line to see a customer service agent at the airport.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration noted Wednesday that low clouds and winds may affect flights in Boston, Tampa, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Seattle, with snow-related delays possible in Minneapolis and Denver.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of weather to watch for the rest of the week.\n\nWednesday\n\nA main area of weather to be concerned with Wednesday afternoon is in Colorado. Monarch Pass in the Rocky Mountains picked up 26 inches. Denver and Colorado Springs saw only between 2 and 4 inches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat snow was winding down, but the same system was sliding east, bringing rain to portions of Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. Interstate 70 could be mess.\n\nThe rain was navigating a baroclinic zone, or zone of temperature clash between frigid air over the Great Lakes and milder air in the Southeast. A storm system will form along that zone by Wednesday evening, causing rain to increase in coverage and intensity across much of the Midwest. It may end as a bit of snow in Indianapolis overnight.\n\nTravel ahead of the holiday has been smooth, with low numbers of flight cancellations and delays over the past week, said Kathleen Bangs, spokeswoman for the flight-tracking service FlightAware.\n\n“Everything is extraordinarily good,” she said Wednesday morning. By early Wednesday afternoon, fewer than 30 U.S. flights scheduled for that day had been canceled and close to 1,650 had been delayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport, where the FAA instituted a ground delay Tuesday because of staffing shortages, has seen about twice the number of delays compared with the same time a year ago, Bangs said.\n\nShe said people should keep an eye on Denver for storm impacts Wednesday, but worse weather appeared to be holding off until Thursday and Friday.\n\n“That’s what you want, because that’s when most people aren’t traveling,” she said.\n\nSkip to end of carousel How to avoid the worst parts of holiday travel illustration for BTW-annoyingtravel (Washington Post illustration; iStock) Long airport lines, highway gridlock and expensive hotels can feel inevitable. But we’ve got tips to relieve your travel pains. End of carousel\n\nThursday\n\nThe storm system will move up the Appalachians. Areas including Cleveland; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Buffalo will all see some snow, but probably only a slushy inch or two of accumulation.\n\nMuch of central and western New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and western Maine will see snow. Accumulations of a few inches are likely, but 4 to 6 inches could fall in the higher terrain, and 6 inches or more in the mountains. There’s a chance that snowfall totals may wind up higher in southern Vermont and New Hampshire if cold air remains entrenched in the region, which is why winter storm watches have been issued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the system’s east side, a slug of heavy rain will work up the Interstate 95 corridor. It will begin around daybreak in Virginia, soaking Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia around sunrise, New York City during the late morning and Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, by lunchtime. Travel along Interstates 95 and 84 will probably be a bit slow.\n\nA cold front dragged east by the low-pressure system could touch off a couple of isolated thunderstorms in the Southeast, with a marginal risk of becoming severe. There’s a very low-end risk of tornadoes.\n\nOtherwise, the majority of the country will be quiet.\n\nBangs, a former airline pilot, said she could foresee delays on the East Coast because of the upcoming rainy weather, but she didn’t expect many cancellations.\n\n“The weather looks like it’s going to be fairly decent across most of the country, so that’s good,” she said.\n\nFriday and beyond\n\nRemarkably, most of the Lower 48 will see mostly calmer weather, though it will be quite cold in the East. The exception to that calm will be around the Great Lakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it’s a bit early to pinpoint specifics, weather models indicate a bowling ball of cold air and low pressure will park overhead. That will steer cold air down the length of the lakes. Water temperatures near Buffalo on Lake Erie are around 51 degrees, but air temperatures will be in the lower to mid-30s.\n\nThat’s a classic recipe for lake-effect snow. The Tug Hill Plateau and regions south of Buffalo could pick up several feet by Monday in narrow swaths, although it’s not clear yet where the bands will become established.\n\nModerate to heavy lake-effect snows are in the snow belts associated with Lakes Huron, Superior and Michigan, although the greater totals will occur in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan or southern Canada."

      "full_content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe earliest dinosaurs were unremarkable, bit players on a supercontinent crowded with other ancient reptiles when they first evolved around 230 million years ago.\n\nFast-forward 30 million years, however, and dinosaurs dominated the planet, coming in all shapes, sizes and forms, while many of their reptilian counterparts had died off. Exactly why they were so evolutionarily successful is a long-standing mystery, but new research suggests some answers to this question may be contained in what they left behind: dinosaur droppings.\n\n“We know a lot about their lives and extinction but not how they came about,” said Martin Qvarnström, lead author of a study on the rise of dinosaurs published Wednesday in the journal Nature and a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\nTo better understand the extinct giants, Qvarnström and his colleagues investigated overlooked fossils known as bromalites: remnants from the digestive system — aka dinosaur poop and vomit.\n\nThey studied more than 500 fossils gathered over a 25-year period from around 10 sites in the Polish Basin, an area in the south of Poland. The remains dated back to a range of time spanning the Late Triassic to early Jurassic Period, from around 247 million years ago to 200 million years ago.\n\n“(Bromalites) contain so much paleoecological information, but I don’t think paleontologists really have acknowledged that and have seen them mostly as like a joke; you collect a few coprolites because it’s funny,” Qvarnström said, referring to fossilized feces. They found that the fossilized poop and vomit — scientifically known as coprolites and regurgitalites, respectively — increased in size and variety over time, indicating the emergence of larger animals and different diets.\n\nBy studying the shape and contents of the bromalites and linking them to fossilized skeletons and footprints found at the sites, researchers were able to identify and categorize the animals that likely produced them.\n\nDoing so allowed the researchers to understand how many and what type and size of dinosaurs, as well as other vertebrate animals, were in the landscape at a given point in time. The analysis, which took 10 years to complete, allowed the team to piece together why dinosaurs came to prominence.\n\nThese footprints belonged to a large theropod dinosaur at a fossil site in Sołtyków, Poland. Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki\n\nRevelations from ancient poop\n\nIn some cases, it was possible to make a visual assessment of what type of dinosaur was responsible for a bromalite based on a fossil’s size and shape — a spiral-shaped coprolite likely came from an animal with a spiral gut — but in many others, it was necessary to take a detailed 3D scan of the bromalite’s internal structure using specialized equipment to understand what the fossils contained.\n\nAncient digestive remnants can “look like something left by your dog in the park and it’s very evident what they are. In other cases, especially herbivores, they’re more difficult to recognize,” he said.\n\nThe team scanned the fossils’ internal structure at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The massive facility, a ring-shaped synchrotron 844 meters (2,800 feet) in circumference, generates X-ray beams 10 trillion times brighter than medical X-rays and allows scientists to study matter at the molecular and atomic level.\n\n“It’s a bit like a CT scanner at the hospital. It works in the same way, but with much higher energy. We need that to get this really high resolution and also good contrast,” Qvarnström said.\n\nThe coprolites contained the remains of fish, insects and plants, and sometimes other prey animals. Some remains were beautifully preserved, including tiny beetles and half-complete fish. Other coprolites contained bones crushed by predators.\n\n“The skeletal fossils, footprints and bromalites from sites in Poland provide a series of discrete temporal snapshots that demonstrate a transition from a world with few dinosaurs to one in which they dominated,” said Lawrence H. Tanner, a paleontologist at the department of biological and environmental sciences at Le Moyne College in New York. Tanner was not involved in the study.\n\n“Using the techniques from this study in other locations would provide a more global context and build a nuanced picture,” Tanner wrote in a commentary piece that published alongside the research.\n\nInformation from fossilized poop helped researchers to understand how dinosaurs rose to prominence 200 million years ago. Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki\n\nReconstructing dinosaurs’ rise\n\nThe authors came up with five phases to explain dinosaurs’ ascendancy: Their ancestors were omnivorous, eating plants and animals. They evolved into the first carnivorous and plant-eating, or herbivorous, dinosaurs.\n\nA key turning point came when increased volcanic activity may have led to a more diverse range of plants to feed upon, followed by the emergence of large and more diverse herbivore dinosaurs.\n\nIn turn, this phase led to the evolution of the giant carnivorous dinosaurs beloved by movie directors and childhood books at the beginning of the Jurassic Period 200 million years ago. The supremacy of the dinosaurs endured until an asteroid that struck off the coast of what’s now Mexico 66 million years ago doomed the dinosaurs to extinction.\n\nBefore this latest research, two theories had been proposed to explain the transition from a world dominated by non-dinosaurian reptiles to one in which the dinosaurs were ascendant, the study noted.\n\nOne model suggested that dinosaurs evolved to physically outcompete their rivals, according to the study. The dinosaurs’ upright stance resulting from the positioning of their hind limbs directly beneath their body, combined with flexible ankles, made them highly agile and more efficient than their evolutionary competitors such as reptiles with splayed legs. Alternatively, some researchers believe dinosaurs were by chance better able to adapt to dramatic changes in climate that took place at the end of the Triassic.\n\nQvarnström said the research based on the Polish fossils suggested a combination of the two hypotheses provided a more likely explanation, with a “complex interplay of several processes” that meant dinosaurs were better able to cope with how environmental shifts changed what food was available.\n\nFor example, the study found that food residues extracted from bromalites belonging to dicynodonts, an ancient mammal relative with a turtle-shaped head, suggested that creature had a restricted diet, feeding principally on conifers. It disappeared from the fossil record around 200 million years ago.\n\nDinosaurs, on the other hand, appeared to eat a wide array of plants. For example, the team found that the contents of coprolites from the first large herbivorous dinosaurs, the sauropodomorphs, contained large quantities of tree ferns but also many other types of plants and charcoal. The team suspects that charcoal helped detoxify the ferns, which can be toxic.\n\nGrzegorz Niedźwiedzki, the study’s senior author and a paleontologist based at Uppsala’s department of organismal biology; evolution and development, said the reason behind the dinosaurs’ evolutionary success was a message that still applied today: “Eat your veggies and live longer.”"

      "full_content": "Deaths from cervical cancer are plummeting among young women in the US, and scientists think we have a single vaccine to thank for the numerous lives saved.\n\nIn the last decade alone, national health data suggests there has been a 62 percent drop in cervical cancer deaths in women under the age of 25.\n\nSenior author Ashish Deshmukh, from the Medical University of South Carolina, attributes the dramatic change to the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nHis team's research did not differentiate between young women who received the vaccine and those who did not, but Deshmukh says he and his colleagues \"cannot think of any other reason that would have contributed to such a marked decline.\"\n\nEspecially since studies in the UK and Australia have found cervical cancer rates are nosediving among those who have received the medicine.\n\nThe multi-dose Gardasil vaccine was approved for young girls in the US in 2006 to prevent deadly strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nHPV is a highly infectious virus that can be transmitted through skin to skin contact, and it is responsible for 70 percent of invasive cervical cancers – one of the most common causes of cancer death among American women.\n\nWhile it is rare for women to develop cervical cancer in their youth, new research suggests the vaccine is making cases under the age of 25 rarer yet.\n\nAccording to national health data, the first cohorts of girls in the US who could receive the HPV vaccine (who were about 10 at the time) were far less likely to die from cervical cancer before the age of 25.\n\nPrevious studies in the US have shown that between 2012 and 2019, there was a 65 percent decline in cervical cancer cases among women under the age of 25. But this is the first study to consider death rates from those patients.\n\nThe research analyzed the health data of women under the age of 25 from 1992 to 2021 in three-year blocks.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1994, the US experienced 55 young cervical cancer deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, that number had dropped to 13 deaths per 100,000 people.\n\n\"The findings from this study highlight the urgency to improve HPV vaccination coverage,\" conclude the authors.\n\nIn the US, HPV vaccination coverage among young girls reached 78.5 percent in 2021, but in the years since, that rate has barely improved, and even shows signs of slipping.\n\nAustralia has one of the highest vaccination rates for HPV in the world, at nearly 86 percent among girls, and by 2028, some national estimates predict there will be fewer than four new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 people - a rate so low the disease could be considered eliminated.\n\nIn fact, a study in 2019 found that thanks to the HPV vaccine, cervical cancer could be eliminated in 149 out of all 181 countries by 2100.\n\nBut that's only if vaccination rates are maintained and improved.\n\nAnd it's not just women whose lives can be saved. While the vaccine was first approved for young women, older women and boys and men can now also receive the HPV vaccine, as it has been found to protect against anal, penile, and oral cancers.\n\nThe HPV vaccine promised a lot, and it's lived up to the challenge. The medicine is now saving far more lives than scientists ever thought possible, turning some of the most deadly diseases into preventable ones.\n\nThe study was published in JAMA."

      "full_content": "When the latest cargo 'shipment' docked at the International Space Station (ISS) this weekend, it delivered more than astronauts had bargained for.\n\nAlong with food, water, clothing, medical and hygiene supplies, and scientific equipment, the uncrewed Russian spacecraft burped up quite an unusual stench.\n\nWafting through the open hatch, astronauts caught an unexpected and strange smell. They also saw small droplets floating in the air.\n\nThe hatch was quickly closed again, and air scrubbers got to work. The next day, contaminant sensors reported normal air quality.\n\nThis might seem like a lot of bother for one funny odor, but on a confined spacecraft, there's no room for funky smells.\n\nNose-scrunching aromas can be a red flag for toxic materials, and even the safest of stenches can build to intolerable levels when there's no escape.\n\nIn this case, the odor emanating from the Progress cargo spacecraft was worrisome enough that Russian astronauts donned protective equipment while the air was being cleaned, according to the reporting of Anatoly Zak of the independent news site Russian Space Web.\n\n\"There are no concerns for the crew,\" reports the official ISS X account, \"and as of Sunday afternoon, the crew is working to open the hatch.\"\n\nOn Nov. 23, the unpiloted Progress 90 resupply spacecraft successfully docked to the International Space Station’s Poisk module. After opening the Progress spacecraft's hatch, the Roscosmos cosmonauts noticed an unexpected odor and observed small droplets, prompting the crew to… — International Space Station (@Space_Station) November 24, 2024\n\nEven on a typical day, the ISS doesn't smell so good. Some astronauts have compared the station's stench to a mix of burnt steak and body odor, and that's after a panel of experts carefully smell tested each and every item sent up there.\n\nBut even if a material smells okay on Earth, it could have a different aroma in space. That's because of a concept known as outgassing, which is what gives that 'new car' smell to freshly made vehicles.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, NASA officials attributed the Progress spacecraft's recent odor and droplets to this phenomenon.\n\nOutgassing can occur when a material is exposed to heat or a vacuum environment, causing it to release gases or water vapor that are trapped inside. These gases can sometimes be odorous, and if kept in a confined area, the smell can build.\n\nThat's why space agencies usually only allow materials with low-outgassing properties to be sent to the ISS. Volatile gases and water vapor can rust surfaces, cloud lenses, cause signal interference, and damage delicate instruments, not to mention their potential threats to astronaut health.\n\nOn the Apollo 8 mission to the Moon, a silicon rubber seal began to outgas severely, contaminating a large observation window temporarily beyond use.\n\nThankfully, nothing so significant has happened this time, but the offending material remains unknown, and there is a chance the problem has to do with the docking mechanism, not anything within Progress itself.\n\nIf that's true, then the smell could linger, even after Progress heads back to Earth."

China expresses its strong dissatisfaction with such slanderous behaviour,” Wu told reporters in a direct reference to the FT report.\n\nWhile reports on the investigation into Dong remain unconfirmed, two other defence ministers have been caught in the anticorruption dragnet.\n\nDong’s predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed after seven months into the job, and then expelled from the Communist Party, for offences that included bribery, according to state media. He has not been seen in public since.\n\nLi’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also kicked out of the party after serving in the post from 2018 to 2023, and referred to prosecutors for alleged corruption.\n\nA Communist Party statement at the time said the pair “betrayed the trust of the party and the Central Military Commission, seriously polluted the political environment of the military, and caused great damage to … the image of its senior leaders”.\n\nThey were found to have received huge sums of money in bribes and to have “sought personnel benefits” for others, it said."

      "full_content": "LAHAINA, Hawaii — The Auburn Tigers very much look like the best team in college basketball.\n\nI understand No. 1 Kansas is still undefeated and will continue to hold the top ranking into December after beating No. 11 Duke while shorthanded Tuesday night in Las Vegas. But no team has been as consistently impressive against higher-ranked competition than the fourth-ranked Tigers. The latest chapter chiseled into their tremendous early season résumé was recorded with ease Wednesday afternoon at the Lahaina Civic Center. Bruce Pearl's Tigers swaggered their way to a 90-76 win over a Memphis team that had looked ultra-confident and of top-20 quality in beating No. 2 Connecticut and Michigan State the prior two days.\n\nIt's the first Maui championship in school history and the second that Auburn coach Bruce Pearl's been a part of; he was on the 1987-88 staff at Iowa that won it all in this cozy gym on the hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Pearl's face is part of a big mural of well-known coaches and players who've come here over the years. When he walked in and saw it, he thought it wasn't deserving.\n\n\"I saw my picture up there on the wall, and it was like Bill Self and Mike Krzyzewski and Tom Izzo, and I'm like, what am I doing up here? Come on,\" Pearl said.\n\nNow it's deserved. The Tigers won three games in three days to run their record to 7-0 and are positively roaring into December.\n\nAuburn is the third SEC team ever to win Maui, which began in 1984, joining Vanderbilt in 1986 and Kentucky in 1993.\n\nChampionships in this beautiful land can often provide the ever-coveted \"Maui bump.\" You win three games in three days here, it portends well for your season. (Five times a Maui champ has gone on to win March Madness, and seven former NCAA champs were in Maui fields the same season they played in this bracket.) Normally, champions have to beat at least two top 25-quality teams, if not three. Over the past 72 hours, Auburn took on an unofficial trio in that realm: No. 5 Iowa State, then No. 12 North Carolina, then unranked, but red-hot, Memphis.\n\nThere's a lot of big stories bubbling up in college basketball in the first few weeks of the season; Auburn showing out as the best-looking team is at the top of the list.\n\nAuburn's Johni Broome showed he just might be the top player in the nation. USATSI\n\nIf you'd like to debate who is the No. 1 team, you can't do the same about the top player. That's Auburn's Johni Broome, the 6-10 fifth-year senior comfortably posting the best numbers in college hoops, who had a phenomenal three-game run here in Lahaina. Broome went on the type of run that will be remembered and associated with Auburn basketball and the Maui Invitational for a long time.\n\n\"He's the best player in college basketball.\"\n\nThose aren't Pearl's words. That's Iowa State coach TJ Otzelberger, who said that to me from the corner of the gym Wednesday as he took a quick peek in on Auburn-Memphis before heading back to the hotel following his team's cruise-control 99-71 win over Colorado. Otzelberger got an up-close look at Broome's big-time capabilities two days ago. The Tigers were in a spot to win a trophy on Wednesday because of Broome's tip-in winner in Monday's quarterfinals. If this is going to be a special season for the Tigers, this will be part of the montage.\n\nOver three games here in paradise, Broome averaged 21.7 points, 15.0 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 4.0 blocks. It's one of the best stat lines ever by a player in this event. His stranglehold on national player of the year status is backed up by his standing at KenPom.com's kPOY tracker. There is a gulf almost as wide as the distance from the Pacific Ocean to the mainland between Broome and the newbie in second place, Duke's Cooper Flagg.\n\nJohni, you are now the November frontrunner for player of the year in college basketball. What do you have to say about that?\n\n\"The player of the year don't really matter to me. I care about winning,\" Broome said shortly after winning the Maui Invitational MVP trophy following his 21-point, 16-rebound, six-assist, four-block showing against the Tigers.\n\nFor the third day in a row he was a stat monster and matchup paradox. Broome set the tone early, logging nine points, five rebounds, three assists and three blocks in the first nine minutes. That's laughable.\n\nMemphis was down 9-0 to start and never had a shot. Broome doused Memphis' will within minutes, including a 3-pointer that caused separation. Broome's fifth straight game with a double-double made him the first Auburn player to do that since Jeff Moore in 1988.\n\n\"Johni has grown a great deal,\" Pearl said, reflecting back to when Broome came to Auburn a few years ago after starting at Morehead State. \"He's matured. One of the things he talked about is, 'Coach trusts me.' I try to hold him accountable. I try to have high expectations for them. So we knock heads, because I'm not satisfied. I know you're capable of more. But he's responded really, really, really well to that. But he's matured. He's become a really good leader on this team.\"\n\nGreat teams are never built around one player. Auburn's returning core is what has Tigers fans hopeful for a special run over the next four months. Auburn has managed to build out a squad that has a star big man but is incredibly deep and running a slick offense. The Tigers are putting up an adjusted 125.1 points per 100 possessions, which beats all other teams in the sport. Nine players average between 15 and 30 minutes; six are in double-digit scoring.\n\n\"We're just a tough scout,\" senior big Dylan Cardwell said. \"Coach Pearl brought in some guys that, when you're scouting guys, you don't know who to stop. I'm sure I wasn't on anybody's scouting report offensively and then I just go off for 18. You don't know who it's going to be.\"\n\nThe defense was outstanding, too. Denver Jones has built himself into an outstanding on-ball defender. He might be the tops in the sport, and if not, very few are sitting at his table. A day after holding All-American candidate RJ Davis to 12 points, he stifled Tyrese Hunter. The Memphis guard had been playing like the best transfer in the country ... and then didn't get a bucket until 16:34 was left in the game.\n\nHe finished with a season-low 11 points.\n\nIf this team approaches every game the way it approached the three here in Maui, it's going to be a top seed in March.\n\nAnd to think, this could've been a very different story.\n\nAuburn had that bizarre plane incident at that start of the season that could have set a tone of dysfunction for a talented team. Instead, the opposite has happened. Pearl's players beat top-five Houston. Then they flew across the ocean and beat top-five Iowa State, followed by top-15 North Carolina and an outright dismissal of a surging Memphis team that's probably going to be ranked next week.\n\nTo that end, Pearl made sure to make a point about this, and his players, in the postgame press conference.\n\n\"Anybody that says student-athletes have changed, anybody that says this is not all about the student-athletes, anybody want to complain about this or that, this is old-school pride, old-school love of their teammates, love their coaches, love their university — Kids haven't changed. Kids want to be coached,\" Pearl said. \"They want to be held accountable. They want to be believed-in, and they want to be held to a high standard. That's just not changed. A lot of things around our game have changed, but this should give you guys and everybody watching hope because it's all about these kids and teaching them.\"\n\nEverything seems attainable and within their control. They're at a place now that most teams need months to work toward.\n\nNow we await on the Maui Bump's mojo. Auburn came here for the first time in 2018. That was the field that famously had Zion Williamson's Duke team playing Gonzaga and Rui Hachimura in the championship. But those teams didn't make the 2019 Final Four. Auburn did.\n\nThis team is definitely better than that one. Carrying November excellence all the way to April is super challenging. But these Tigers have the pieces, offense, experience and camaraderie to do it. They'll get little time to bask in the sunshine. Next up is a road test against No. 11 Duke on Wednesday.\n\nJohni Broome vs. Cooper Flagg. Duke vs. Auburn. It could be a Final Four matchup in the first week of December. Is this shaping up to be a great season or what?"

Of particular interest to the FTC is the way Microsoft bundles its cloud products with its office and security tools, says The New York Times.\n\nAs it notes, the aggressive move comes as the FTC’s chair, Lina Khan, is likely to depart once Donald Trump enters office.\n\nIt’s unclear if Trump will continue President Joe Biden’s push to rein in big tech companies. Under Biden, the FTC sued Amazon and Meta, accusing them of stifling rivals, while the Justice Department sued Google over its dominance in ad technology and Apple for making it difficult for customers to leave its product ecosystem."

      "full_content": "Jugs of raw milk fill a refrigerator at Raw Farm dairy in Fresno in June. (Tomas Ovalle / For The Times)\n\nLess than a week after California health officers confirmed a finding of bird flu virus in store-bought raw milk, state agriculture officials descended on Mark McAfee's Raw Farm dairy \"like never before\" Wednesday and began collecting samples from the farm's two herds, creamery, bulk milk tanks and trucks, according to the owner.\n\nThe visit follows a recall of Raw Farm products, and also comes amid a growing series of H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in state dairy farms. Raw Farm maintains 1,800 head of cattle spread over two herds — one in Fresno, the other outside of Hanford, according to McAfee. The company also owns a Fowler-based creamery.\n\n\"I think they are on full attack mode,\" he said, describing the search as thorough. In addition to milk, Raw Farm produces cheese and kefir.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs California Department of Food and Agriculture officials collected samples and conducted tests at the dairy Wednesday, some health experts raised questions and concerns about the recent positive test results.\n\nRead more: Despite warnings from bird flu experts, it's business as usual in California dairy country\n\nLast week, public health officials in Santa Clara County detected bird flu virus in a store-bought sample of McAfee's raw milk. Two days later, the California Department of Public Health confirmed the finding.\n\nBut when state agriculture officials tested cows at McAfee's dairy farm on Monday, they failed to detect the virus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe fact that none of the animals are known to be infected with the virus has puzzled and concerned public health experts. Generally, once the virus appears on a farm, it spreads and does not just disappear.\n\n\"The fact that all the supplemental testing is negative really bothers me,\" said John Korslund, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian epidemiologist, in an email.\n\nOfficials from the CDFA could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but infectious disease experts told The Times that officials probably were reviewing testing procedures, as well as the actual origin of the sampled milk.\n\nAccording to testing records, the initial sample of store-bought raw milk carried high levels of the virus, and was found to have a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold — or Ct — of roughly 25.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"A herd should not be immediately negative after a reading of 25 if it is truly milk from the same herd, IMO,\" Korslund wrote in an email.\n\nRichard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, and a researcher in the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., agreed.\n\n\"OK, that’s not a weak positive … and definitely not on the borderline where some tests would be positive and others negative,\" he said after reviewing the test records.\n\nWebby, Korslund and other experts say the test that was used only looks for the H5 part of the H5N1 virus, and it can't determine if the virus is inactive or alive. A second test — one called a virus isolation test — needs to be done to confirm the sample is H5N1 and that it is active.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead more: Warning issued for contaminated raw milk sold in L.A. County stores\n\nState and federal health officials say the H5N1 bird flu virus poses a low risk to the public. However, they have urged people not to drink raw, unpasteurized milk. There has been no reported outbreak in consumers associated with the bird flu in contaminated raw milk.\n\nThe milk was bottled on Nov. 9. Raw Farm has recalled all products associated with the positive sample. McAfee estimates the recall involved roughly 2,000 gallons of half- and quarter-gallon \"cream top\" whole milk products.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, 461 herds have been infected in California — including herds in Fresno and Kings County, where McAfee's herds are located.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEarly in the H5N1 dairy outbreak, federal health officials tested pasteurized milk samples and found virus in 20% of the samples collected from retail shelves. However, when further testing was conducted — virus isolation — they were able to show it was inactivated virus that had been denatured by heat.\n\nSo, why then would a raw milk sample test high for virus and a dairy herd not test positive?\n\nKorslund acknowledged that testing and sampling can sometimes be compromised, but he was not inclined to doubt the tests in this instance. He said the Ct value — and the lack of subsequent positive tests — suggests a \"product integrity issue rather than a herd infection.\"\n\n\"What if somewhere in the bottling process, pasteurized shelf milk was spiked into the raw milk to meet inadequate supply demands? In such a scenario, we don't have a testing issue; rather it's a product integrity issue that normally would be undetectable,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is why virus isolation testing is critical, Korslund said. It would help determine whether the virus in the sample collected was alive or not.\n\nA spokesman for the state's health department said testing on the sample was complete. He did not say whether viral isolation had been completed, but noted the positive result has been confirmed by state and now federal laboratories.\n\nMcAfee said he does not think the virus is present in his herd. The tests that the state's agriculture department have been regularly conducting — twice a week — on his bulk milk have been negative. In addition, he noted, a test taken on Monday also showed no virus.\n\nHe said he also monitors each cow at his farms with a high-tech device — made by the Austrian company smaXtec — that sits in a cow's udder and sends real-time information about the animal's body temperature, milk acidity, etc.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe said there are no indications that virus is moving through his herd based on those data.\n\nHe also said all his operations — including his trucks, his bulk tanks and bottling plant — are closed to outside farms and milk; they are used only by Raw Farm.\n\nHe said he's worried state officials are determined \"to find something.\"\n\n\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

      "full_content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFor oral medications that prevent new HIV infection to be effective, the patient must take certain actions, including attending doctor's visits every three months and—most importantly—consistency.\n\nThese daily oral antiretrovirals, more commonly referred to as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), such as Truvada, are extremely effective at HIV prevention, but only if they are taken daily as directed. Truvada's efficacy is greatly compromised when taken inconsistently.\n\nHowever, results from a clinical trial (Purpose-2) led by physicians at Emory University and Grady Health System indicate that a twice-yearly injection of Lenacapavir offers a 96% reduced risk of infection overall, making the injection significantly more effective than the daily oral PrEP. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"Seeing these high levels of efficacy—at almost 100%—in an injectable that people only have to take every six months is incredible,\" says Colleen Kelley, MD, lead author of the study and professor in the School of Medicine at Emory University.\n\n\"This is a considerable and profound advancement in medicine, especially for people whose circumstances don't allow them to take a daily oral medication, and for those among populations disproportionately impacted by HIV.\"\n\nIn the randomized, double-blind, Phase III clinical trial comparing the efficacy of the two medications, 99% of the participants in the Lenacapavir group did not acquire an HIV infection.\n\nDuring the trial, only two participants in the Lenacapavir group, comprised of 2,179 people, acquired HIV. This compares to nine new HIV infections in the Truvada group, which had 1,086 people. The trial showed that adherence to the injectable was higher than of the daily oral pill.\n\nKelley, also the co-director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research, and Associate Dean for Research for Emory at Grady adds that while PrEP is incredibly effective at preventing infection, part of what made the injection more effective in the clinical trial was the challenges associated with adherence to a daily oral pill.\n\n\"What we see over time is that about half of people who start taking daily oral PrEP stop within a year due to various factors,\" says Kelley, referencing health care disparities in general. \"Having an effective injectable that is only needed twice annually is very significant for people who have trouble accessing health care or staying adherent to daily, oral pills.\"\n\nThe inclusion of racially, ethnically, and gender-diverse participants in the clinical trial was notable because it was representative of populations disproportionately impacted by HIV in real time. For example, the trial groups were comprised of cisgender men and gender-diverse people at 88 sites in Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, and the U.S.\n\nAccording to the study, the same populations that are disproportionately impacted by HIV are the same populations that have limited access to PrEP—or may have difficulty consistently taking the oral antiretroviral medication—ultimately highlighting the need for more options.\n\nThe study also indicates that more than half of the new HIV infections nationwide in 2022 were among cisgender gay men, and 70% of those were among Black or Hispanic individuals.\n\nValeria Cantos, MD, associate professor in the School of Medicine at Emory University, physician at Grady Memorial Hospital, and the principal investigator for the clinical trial at the Grady research site, emphasized the importance of having trials that include populations truly representative of the patients that Grady serves.\n\n\"At Grady, our focus is on increased representation of underserved and vulnerable populations, acknowledging and addressing the distrust towards research held by some community members due to prior abuses or neglect of these populations by research institutions in the past,\" Cantos says. \"Grady is an established, trusted research site because of its commitment to equity.\"\n\nAt the Grady clinical trial site, medical materials were available in Spanish, and bilingual staff members recruited and enrolled trial participants who only spoke Spanish. Cantos also indicated that the site enrolled participants who are representative of the populations that would benefit the most from Lenacapavir. In addition to Grady, the Hope Clinic and Emory Midtown Hospital were among the 88 sites supporting the clinical trial.\n\n\"We are not reaching everyone we need to reach with our current HIV prevention interventions, such as those who are disproportionately impacted by HIV and health care disparities,\" says Kelley. \"For people that are unable to take the daily oral pills, the injectable agents can really give incredible efficacy and be a game changer in helping them stay HIV negative.\"\n\nSince the Phase III clinical trial has been completed and submitted by the FDA for consideration, Kelley is hopeful that Lenacapavir may be approved by 2025 for commercial use.\n\n\"The results of this study add to the armamentarium of novel tools for HIV prevention. Long-acting antiretrovirals offer new hope for those who are not able to take oral medications,\" says Carlos del Rio, MD, chair of the Department of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine.\n\n\"The challenge is now to roll out and make these tools available and accessible in an equitable way—only then we will see new HIV infections dramatically decreased locally and globally,\" adds del Rio, also co-director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research.\n\nMore information: Colleen Kelley, et al.

      "full_content": "An illustration of the Europa Clipper spacecraft with its solar arrays, magnetometer's boom and several antennas for the radar instrument deployed.\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper mission has successfully deployed two of its science instruments as it makes its way to the Jupiter system.\n\nLaunched on Oct. 14, the Europa Clipper spacecraft is currently en route to study Jupiter's icy moon Europa , which is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean. The mission lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. It has since ventured 13 million miles (20 million kilometers) from Earth, traveling at a speed of 22 miles per second (35 kilometers per second) relative to the sun, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n\"Europa Clipper is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission,\" NASA officials said in the statement . \"It will travel 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers) to arrive at Jupiter in 2030 and in 2031 will begin a series of 49 flybys, using a suite of instruments to gather data that will tell scientists if the icy moon and its internal ocean have the conditions needed to harbor life.\"\n\nThe spacecraft has so far operated as expected, having deployed its massive solar arrays shortly after launch. The solar arrays, which extend the length of a basketball court, collect sunlight to power the spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter , and during its science work in the Jovian system.\n\nRelated: SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launches NASA's Europa Clipper probe to explore icy Jupiter ocean moon (video)\n\nRecently, the magnetometer's boom and several antennas for the spacecraft's radar instrument were deployed and will remain extended from the spacecraft for the full duration of the mission.\n\nMeasuring 28 feet (8.5 meters), the boom uncoiled from a canister mounted on the spacecraft body. Sensors paired with the hardware confirmed the deployment was successful. Once the spacecraft reaches Jupiter, the magnetometer will be used to measure the magnetic field around Europa. This will help scientists confirm the existence of the ocean believed to lie beneath the moon's icy crust and measure its depth and salinity, according to the statement.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Engineering data transmitted back from the spacecraft allows the mission team to assess how the hardware is operating.\n\n\"It's an exciting time on the spacecraft, getting these key deployments done,\" Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in the statement. \"Most of what the team is focusing on now is understanding the small, interesting things in the data that help them understand the behavior of the spacecraft on a deeper level. That's really good to see.\"\n\nThe team will continue to check the spacecraft's hardware, with seven more instruments expected to power on and off in a series of tests planned for December and January.\n\nTo reach Jupiter, Clipper will perform a few gravity assists by looping around Mars and then back around Earth. This maneuver allows the spacecraft to leverage a planet's gravitational pull to gain speed and alter its trajectory."

I have NFL player props to target for all four games.\n\nLet's get into my NFL player props for Week 13 — keep tabs on this story as I continue to add more NFL Week 13 prop picks as we progress through the holiday games and into Sunday.\n\nSean Koerner's NFL Player Props\n\nThe Biggest PRO Sale of the Year Is Here! Best bets for every game Live expert pick alerts Prop picks, TD edges & more SAVE $40 NOW\n\nBears vs. Lions Player Prop: Cole Kmet Receiving Yards\n\nThursday, Nov 28 12:30 p.m. ET CBS Cole Kmet Under 33.5 Receiving Yards (-110)\n\nWe cashed on Kmet's over 2.5 receptions last week when he ended with seven because I liked his upside against the Vikings.\n\nHowever, Kmet's target share has been really inconsistent this year and this is a tougher matchup for him.\n\nThe Lions rank first in DVOA against tight ends, allowing the lowest yards per attempt to the position, and only three tight ends have cleared this number against them this year.\n\nA huge reason for this is that the Lions use man coverage at the highest rate in the league. That means you typically get safeties Brian Branch or Kerby Joseph locked onto opposing tight ends.\n\nLinebacker Alex Anzalone was the best Lions defender for opposing teams to target when he was covering the tight end, so the fact that he's on IR may actually make this matchup tougher, and the other linebackers have been better in coverage.\n\nKmet is also the Bears' pass-catcher who has seen the biggest dropoff in yards per route run against man coverage (nearly a full yard lower at -0.8), so he gets the biggest hit of the group here.\n\nWith the wide receiver trio playing at a high level right now and Caleb Williams using his legs more, it'll make it easier to avoid too many targets going Kmet's way on Thursday.\n\nI'm projecting his median closer to 28 yards and give him around a 61% chance of staying under 33.5.\n\nAlso of note: I would pivot to under 3.5 receptions (anything -120 or better) if his yardage dips to 31.5 or lower.\n\nGiants vs. Cowboys Player Prop: Brian Burns Tackles + Assists\n\nThursday, Nov 28 4:30 p.m. ET FOX Brian Burns Under 4.5 Tackles + Assists (-110)\n\nThis isn't a number Burns typically clears as he's stayed under this 72% of the time, and that's despite having a fairly good schedule for tackle opportunities for an EDGE rusher.\n\nThe Cowboys are a below-average matchup for EDGE rushers, too, and Burns has stayed under this 83% of the time against teams that are below-league-average in tackle opportunities for EDGE rushers.\n\nPlus, Cooper Rush is pretty good at avoiding sacks. He gets rid of it quickly and does a good job of avoiding sacks when he's under pressure. He's also not a threat to scramble, and the Cowboys run inside the tackles at the highest rate in the league. Burns will have less of an opportunity to make a tackle on those types of runs.\n\nAs if this prop couldn't get any better, this game is being played at Jerry World, which has the stingiest scorekeeper in terms of dishing out assists. Maybe it's because the sun gets in their eyes?\n\nI'm projecting Burns closer to 3.8 tackles on Thursday and give him around a 65% chance of staying under 4.5.\n\nDolphins vs. Packers Player Prop: Jalen Ramsey Tackles + Assists\n\nThursday, Nov 28 8:20 p.m. ET NBC Jalen Ramsey Under 4.5 Tackles + Assists (-110)\n\nRamsey typically stays under this number and has done so 64% of the time this season, including 75% of the time when facing teams that are below the league average in tackle opportunities to cornerbacks. On Thursday night, he faces a Packers team that provides the fewest tackle opportunities to cornerbacks in the league.\n\nThat's because Jordan Love tends to spread it around. He also tends to throw downfield at a high rate, which brings safeties into play and also leads to a lower completion percentage.\n\nAdditionally, the Packers have been more run-heavy lately. Josh Jacobs runs inside at one of the highest rates in the league, which lowers the chances for Ramsey to be in on run plays.\n\nRamsey will likely be on either Christian Watson or Dontayvion Wicks for most of the game. Both are downfield threats, and with Kendall Fuller expected to miss the game, Love will probably want to focus on targeting the side of the field that Ramsey isn't on.\n\nI'm projecting Ramsey closer to 3.8 tackles on Thursday night at Lambeau Field, and give him around a 65% chance of staying under 4.5.\n\nRaiders vs. Chiefs Player Prop: DeAndre Hopkins Receiving Yards\n\nFriday, Nov 29 3 p.m. ET Amazon Prime Video DeAndre Hopkins Under 41.5 Receiving Yards (-115)\n\nHopkins will be key for the Chiefs in the playoffs and in their quest to three-peat. But they've been pretty cautious with his playing time since acquiring him from Tennessee.\n\nHopkins has seen his routes run go down for four straight games now, and while I think that number has probably bottomed out and expect it to go up from here, he will still be out there for roughly half of Patrick Mahomes' drop-backs.\n\nThe key here is that I think the number of drop-backs will be fewer on Friday against the Raiders. I expect the Chiefs to be more run-heavy, particularly with Isiah Pacheco expected to return to action.\n\nLikewise, the Raiders have really struggled against tight ends this season, so there's a good chance the duo of Travis Kelce and Noah Gray will be part of the focus of the passing game.\n\nHopkins will still draw a handful of targets, of course, but it's unlikely he will be able to maintain the 81% catch rate he's seen since joining the Chiefs when he's had a 65% expected catch rate, according to NextGenStats.\n\nI'm projecting Hopkins' median closer to 36.5 yards on Friday and give him around a 58% chance of staying under 41.5 yards."

      "full_content": "Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR All three models in the Galaxy S25 series have appeared on the FCC website, confirming key specs.\n\nWired charging speeds and battery capacities could remain the same as last year for all models.\n\nThe standard Galaxy S25 would likely skip out on UWB once again.\n\nUpdate, November 28, 2024 (03:44 AM ET): The article mistakenly confused WPT (wireless power transfer) to mean wireless charging when it actually means reverse wireless charging. The article has been accordingly corrected, and the error is regretted. Original article, November 27, 2024 (02:38 PM ET): The Galaxy S25 series is expected to launch in the next few months, and as we get closer to the launch date, more and more leaks and rumors are starting to surface. Thanks to a recent appearance on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website, we now have a clearer picture of what Samsung’s 2025 flagship lineup might look like.\n\nSpotted by 91mobiles, the listings include all three models in the Galaxy S25 series earning their certifications for a US launch. And while some of the details may feel familiar, there are a few surprises (and disappointments) hidden in the fine print.\n\nFirst things first, let’s get the formalities out of the way. The FCC listing confirms the US model numbers: SM-931U for the Galaxy S25, SM-936U for the S25 Plus, and SM-938U for the S25 Ultra. As expected, all three devices will be decked out with 5G, dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GNSS, and NFC, all the connectivity bells and whistles you’d expect from a premium smartphone. Of course, the Galaxy S25 Ultra wouldn’t be complete without its trusty S Pen, which also made an appearance with model number EJ-PS938.\n\nNow, for the new stuff. The listing confirms that the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra will include UWB support, which is useful for precision tracking of items like smart tags or locating lost devices. Unfortunately, the standard Galaxy S25 will once again sit this one out.\n\nThe listing also sheds light on charging speeds, and it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The Galaxy S25 is listed with a travel adapter model number EP-TA800, which translates to 25W wired charging — the same as its predecessor. The listing mentions 9W of WPT (wireless power transfer), referring to what is popularly known as reverse wireless charging.\n\nOn the brighter side, the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra were tested with the EP-T2510 travel adapter, suggesting they’ll stick with the 45W wired fast charging of their predecessors.\n\nWhile the FCC listing doesn’t explicitly mention battery capacity, previous rumors suggest that the S25 series will likely retain the same battery sizes as the S24 lineup. Under the hood, we’re expecting the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset to power all three models.\n\nIf history is any guide, Samsung should make the Galaxy S25 series announcement sometime in January 2025. While these FCC filings hint that Samsung will stick to its tried and tested formula, we’re still hoping that Samsung will have some surprises in store for us when the series finally debuts.\n\nGot a tip?

      "full_content": "It was already pretty hot by the time Donald Johanson and his graduate student, Tom Gray, arrived at the site at Hadar, Ethiopia, on the morning of November 24, 1974. The two had initially set out to map the location but decided to have a look around for any signs of fossils while they were there. Unfortunately, there were very few fossils visible on the surface at the time, but they did manage to find some fragments belonging to antelopes, gazelles, and even a bit of a monkey. Not exactly the most auspicious of finds for a site that was known to have sediments that are over 3 million years old.\n\nAs the baking sun reached its zenith, the two researchers started back to the car, but they decided to go via a different route along a gully. It was at this point that Johanson happened to look over his shoulder and something caught his eye. Lying on a slope was a small piece of bone that appeared to be the right proximal ulna (forearm) of some sort of animal – probably a monkey. However, as he turned the piece over in his hand, Johanson realized he was looking at something different – it appeared to belong to some sort of hominid.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile examining the rest of the slope, Johanson and Gray then found a piece of skull bone, a femur, a pelvis, some ribs, and a lower jaw complete with some teeth.\n\nThese bones were tiny, but over the next few weeks of further excavation, Johanson, Gray, and colleagues discovered several hundred bone fragments at the site now known as Afar Locality 288. They carefully logged the exact location for each piece and then took them back to camp for further analysis. Eventually, the team had collected around 40 percent of a single skeleton belonging to a previously unknown hominid species.\n\nAt the time, Johanson and Gray knew they had something special on their hands, but they were not aware of just how significant this find was and what it would mean for our understanding of human ancestry.\n\nIt has now been 50 years since Lucy’s skeleton was found on that Ethiopian slope, and over the decades she has become an iconic figure in the story of human evolution.\n\nLucy on a slope with gravel\n\n\"Lucy\" may not sound like a name you’d give an important scientific specimen, but it is pretty memorable, as is the story of how it came about.\n\nShe began to emerge as a personality as well as an important scientific discovery. Donald Johanson\n\nAs Johanson told IFLScience, while the excavation team relaxed in their camp on that night in November 1974, he and his then girlfriend, Pamela Alderman, were discussing the potential sex of the mysterious specimen when The Beatles’ 1967 hit Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds came on the radio. As Johanson was convinced the bones belonged to a female individual, they decided to nickname her Lucy.\n\nHadar, Ethiopia, where Lucy's remains were discovered in 1974.

From then on, everyone just started saying things like ‘Are we going to go back to the Lucy site? Do you think we'll find more of Lucy's skull? How old do you think Lucy was when she died? Etc, etc.’”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“So she began to emerge as a personality as well as an important scientific discovery.”\n\nAnd that’s a significant component of Lucy’s legacy.\n\n“[S]he's become sort of the benchmark... I think that even more than [being just a skeleton], people recognize this discovery as an individual.”\n\nLucy and Australopithecus afarensis\n\nAustralopithecus afarensis is a member of the australopithecine group, early hominins (humans and their close and now extinct relatives) that lived in Africa around 4.1 to 1.4 million years ago. Prior to Lucy’s discovery in 1974, palaeoanthropologists were aware of only one other member of this group – Australopithecus africanus (meaning “southern ape of Africa”) – which had been discovered back in 1924. But, at this time, fossil discoveries were extremely limited, so not much was known about these ancient hominids.\n\nLucy's remains laid out. Image courtesy of the Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University\n\nThe relatively complete nature of Lucy’s remains, however, provided an unprecedented understanding of the species. Importantly, Lucy’s skeleton indicated that these early hominids were bipedal, walking upright on two legs, like modern humans. For instance, Lucy’s distal femur (the lower part of her thigh bone that forms the top part of the knee joint) has several features that are unique to bipedality. This includes the angle of its shaft relative to the condyles (the rounded part of the joint), which allowed Lucy to balance on each leg, one after the other, as she walked.\n\nIf we had developed big brains first and were still quadrupedal, and we were out there looking over the tall grass, you would announce that you were on the menu. Donald Johanson\n\nThese condyles are also quite large, suggesting they could handle the increased weight that comes with this type of locomotion. Other markers of bipedality include the shape of her pelvis, which is adapted for upright balance; and significantly, her talus – the bone in the ankle that connects foot to leg – shows signs of a big toe that would have been used for balance and shock absorption, rather than the manipulative abilities we see in monkeys and apes.\n\nBut despite the significance of this evidence, not everyone was convinced of Lucy’s importance. As with so many instances in the history of science, some members of the wider scientific community took some time to accept that they were indeed dealing with not only a new species of hominid, but also one that walked upright.\n\n“There was a lot of opposition as to the meaning of the diversity in the specimens,” Johanson explained. Some researchers believed that, rather than walking upright like a human, Lucy was merely “the ape that stood up,” meaning she walked with bent hips and bent knees.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“That’s not a very efficient way to walk,” Johanson added. “I mean, you're expending so much energy; you fatigue extremely quickly.”\n\nIn terms of human evolution, Lucy’s ability to walk on two legs suggested that humans (and their relatives) evolved bipedality before their brains increased in size. This was an important realization: Lucy had the anatomy for walking on two legs, but the brain case of her skull was “very small”. As Johanson explained, “The endocranial volume was sort of like what you would typically see in a chimpanzee.”\n\n“This meant the long-standing argument about ‘did we stand up first and then get big brains so that we could, you know, leave the forest trees or the forest, and then make a living out on the Savannah’ was settled,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“If we had developed big brains first and were still quadrupedal, and we were out there looking over the tall grass, you would announce that you were on the menu. So in terms of natural selection, you’d be gone.”\n\nHow do we know Lucy was female and how old was she?\n\nOkay, so Lucy’s skeleton can tell us a lot about how these hominids moved, but how do we know she was female and not, as Johanson said, “Lucifer”, a male? Well, according to Johanson, it was obvious the specimen was female from the moment he found the fossil fragments, and this related to their size.\n\nAlthough the difference between modern male and female humans is very limited, apes and other ancient human ancestors had high levels of what is called “sexual dimorphism” – difference in size and shape between male and females. This was also true for Australopithecus afarensis.\n\n“You have sexual dimorphism. Yes, differences in size and all of these early human ancestors had males that were significantly larger [than females], probably because they're being selected for large size, perhaps for protection of the troop they're living in, and also warding off predators and so on.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“And females are being kept small because they have very high energy requirements, you know, nurturing a foetus, giving birth, breastfeeding a child.”\n\nGiven how small Lucy’s bones are, it would suggest a female individual. Some may argue that perhaps this means the specimen was just a child, but Lucy’s teeth also show signs of age. Her jawbone has third molars – her wisdom teeth – which have erupted and have begun to wear. This would suggest Lucy was at least a young adult when she died.\n\nAt the same time, Lucy’s bones and skull had fused, suggesting she had completed her skeletal development.\n\nWhat happened to Lucy?\n\nIt is currently unclear how Lucy died, but we can infer a few things from her bones. Firstly, there is no indication that she was killed by a predator. If she had been attacked by an animal, you would expect to see marks from teeth or claws on her remains, but she is free of such evidence.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2016, a study conducted a CT scan of her bones and suggested that Lucy had fractures in her shoulder joint and arm that are consistent with those experienced by someone falling from a height. However, this study’s conclusions remain controversial and have not been accepted by everyone, including Johanson, who believes the fractures could have occurred postmortem.\n\nThe future of our (evolutionary) past\n\nOver the last 50 years, Lucy (along with subsequent discoveries) has helped us understand significant aspects of our evolutionary heritage. However, there remain many questions yet to be answered. Johanson would like to think that, in the next 50 years, palaeoanthropologists will be able to address current mysteries related to the palaeoenvironment in which Lucy and other members of her species lived. In particular, this could help explain why some species of ancient hominins died out while others survived.\n\nAt the same time, there are still many questions related to the development of human intelligence, and at what point, and under what conditions, did our brains start to grow in size?\n\nDonald Johanson arriving at the Hadar Research Project site in Ethiopia in January 2024.

So I think we want to know not just what types of changes were going on but the reason why they happened.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThese are just some of the questions that are being explored at the moment by palaeoanthropologists. Perhaps they will be answered in the near future or maybe it will take longer, but it will be interesting to see whether Lucy plays any role, or whether the findings add to what we know of this enigmatic individual."

      "full_content": "A jury just awarded a Rio Rancho man with what could be the largest medical malpractice in history.\n\nRIO RANCHO, N.M. – A jury just awarded a Rio Rancho man with what could be the largest medical malpractice verdict in history.\n\nThe Rio Rancho man ended up suing NuMale Medical Center at Wyoming and Paseo because of what he’s gone through and lasting medical consequences.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the physician assistant in this case is Steven Chapman. The victim – Michael – told Chapman he was interested in testosterone replacement therapy to improve his energy and a medically managed weight loss plan.\n\nBut according to the lawsuit, Chapman brought up erectile dysfunction. Even though Michael said he was not interested in ED treatment, Chapman told him it was designed to work with the testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nUltimately, Michael purchased a plan which included testosterone pellet implants in his butt and at home penis injections.\n\nWhen Michael felt the medications weren’t working, he went back to the office. The lawsuit states Chapman said Michael wasn’t doing it right, demonstrated the penis injection, and sent him home with a medically induced erection.\n\n“This physician assistant injected the chemical into his penis because he couldn’t figure out how to do it, and he injected 75% more of the chemical and a stronger dose than he should have, and sent the patient home and said ‘Go show all your friends.’ This is what he said to a 66-year-old man,” said Nicholas Rowley, Michael’s attorney.\n\nThe lawsuit states Michael couldn’t get rid of the erection over the weekend and went back to the clinic. Medical staff tried painful and embarrassing procedures to help Michael, but it didn’t work.\n\nChapman reportedly told Michael to drive himself to the emergency room where he had emergency surgery. But the damage was done.\n\n“His penis is dead. It’s actually, what it is now is it is much smaller than what it was, and it’s just a lump of scar tissue that doesn’t work in any way shape or form,” said Rowley.\n\nRowley says the urologist who treated his client claimed he’d seen cases like this before. But the close to half a billion dollar verdict will keep it from happening again.\n\nHe also wants this to be a reminder for people.\n\n“If someone’s trying to sell you something medically, take a step back, ask other health care providers, get second opinions and third opinions. If there’s advertisements saying something’s going to be a quick fix for a problem, don’t trust it. Don’t trust it,” said Rowley.\n\nThe jury awarded Michael $412 million, but it could surpass $550 million once interest kicks in.\n\nKOB 4 did get a statement from NuMale Medical Center’s president, Brad Palubicki. He says NuMale Medical Center is committed to high quality and safe patient care. They disagree with the verdict and intend to pursue all available legal remedies, including appeal."
