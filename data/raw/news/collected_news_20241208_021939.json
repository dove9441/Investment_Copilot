      "full_content": "The Green Bay Packers were able to overcome a slow start, but a run-down defense missing multiple starters ran out of gas late, and the Detroit Lions used scores on three of their last four possessions to escape Ford Field with a 34-31 win on Thursday night.\n\nJake Bates’ 35-yard field goal as time expired ended up being the difference.\n\nAlong the way, the explosive Packers and aggressive Lions traded blows in an entertaining and occasionally chaotic shootout in primetime.\n\nHere’s what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward:\n\nWhat went right\n\n— Despite a slow start, Jordan Love caught fire in the second half and was a big reason why the Packers had a chance to win the game late. He completed 12 passes for 206 yards, threw a third-down touchdown pass to Tucker Kraft, didn’t have a turnover and hit both a 59-yard bomb and an incredible 29-yarder under intense pressure to Christian Watson. Love was 9-of-13 passing for 175 yards in the second half.\n\n— The Packers erased a 17-7 half-time deficit in all of three minutes and 45 seconds to start the third quarter. Love hit Watson for 59 yards and Kraft for the third-down touchdown to cut the Lions’ lead to 17-14, and Keisean Nixon’s interception of Jared Goff set up a Josh Jacobs touchdown run that gave the Packers their first lead. It was an excellent response after an ugly first 30 minutes.\n\n— Christian Watson caught four passes for 114 yards. He lost the fumble in the first half setting up a field goal, but he also set up 10 points for the Packers with explosive plays.\n\n— Josh Jacobs helped the Packers go 4-for-5 scoring touchdowns in the red zone. He scored three times inside 10 yards. He would have had a fourth touchdown had officials not flagged Watson for a questionable offensive pass interference penalty on the Packers’ final drive.\n\n— The Packers run defense gave up three explosive runs but ended up allowing only 3.3 yards per attempt across 34 rushes from the Lions. Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery were not game-breakers on the ground. The run defense is really starting to take shape over the three games.\n\n— Love scrambled four times for 23 yards, including a 14-yarder to convert a first down. He is looking more and more mobile.\n\n— Rashan Gary had a third-down sack to end a drive, and Quay Walker produced a huge fourth-down stop with a stuff of Gibbs.\n\n— Defensive lineman Kenny Clark played his best game of the season. He had eight tackles, including a tackle for loss.\n\n— Dontayvion Wicks caught a season-high four passes and produced three first downs. He made a catch through contact on a 26-yarder in the second half and didn’t have a drop.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\n— The Packers defense gave up only 5.1 yards per play but allowed conversions on 4-of-5 fourth downs and ran out of gas while facing 76 plays. The Lions scored on three of their final four possessions, including a methodical touchdown drive after the Packers went up 28-24 and an easy march after the Packers tied the game at 31.\n\n— The Lions scored a pair of touchdowns on fourth-and-goal.\n\n— Jared Goff was sacked only once on 42 dropbacks, and the Packers finished with only three quarterback hits. The pass-rush wasn’t good enough again.\n\n— The Packers started slow, giving up a touchdown on the Lions’ opening drive and going punt-punt-fumble on their first three offensive possessions. Green Bay trailed 17-7 at half — the third time this season they’ve trailed the Lions or Vikings by 10 or more after two quarters.\n\n— Goff completed 32 passes, many on easy, well-timed screens or in-breaking dig routes to the middle of the field.\n\n— The Packers offense converted only 1-of-5 third down opportunities. The Lions, meanwhile, converted 11 third or fourth downs. That resulted in a massive disparity in terms of total plays and time of possession — a big deal considering both teams were playing a third game in 12 days.\n\n— Jayden Reed dropped a second-down pass in the first half and finished with zero catches and zero touches. He played only 25 snaps.\n\n— Josh Jacobs scored three touchdowns, but he averaged only 3.7 yards per attempt despite facing mostly backups in the Lions front seven. The Packers offensive line struggled in the run game and were slow to figure out Detroit’s many blitzes.\n\n— Watson’s fumble created a lost possession, and Quay Walker’s 15-yard penalty set up Detroit’s field goal on the ensuing drive.\n\n— Former Packer Za’Darius Smith went right through Zach Tom to sack Love on the first play from scrimmage. He also got away with a roughing the passer when he hit Love in the head following a throw in the first half.\n\nWhat it means\n\nThe NFC North race is over for the Packers, and now it’s wildcard or bust. Matt LaFleur’s team is still in a terrific position to earn one of the three wildcard spots, and securing the No. 5 or No. 6 seed would mean going on the road to play either the NFC South or NFC West winner in the first round. Not a bad spot. While disappointing, Thursday night’s loss showed the Packers can go anywhere and play with the best of the best in the NFC. Jordan Love is playing at a high level, and a hot quarterback can beat anyone. This team needs to get healthy, stack a few wins over the final four games and earn a chance to go back to Detroit in January.\n\nHighlights\n\nWhat’s next\n\nA chance to rest up and recover before another big game in the NFC playoff race. The Packers — who just played three games in 12 days — get the mini-bye of a Thursday night game before heading to Seattle to play the NFC West-leading Seahawks next Sunday night. Another primetime road game against a division leader. A win in Seattle would essentially guarantee a playoff spot. This is a great opportunity to bounce back from a tough defeat and get a big win over a playoff contender."

      "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is weighing whether to issue sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, a preemptive move that would be a novel and risky use of the president’s extraordinary constitutional power.\n\nThe deliberations so far are largely at the level of White House lawyers. But Biden himself has discussed the topic with some senior aides, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday to discuss the sensitive subject. No decisions have been made, the people said, and it is possible Biden opts to do nothing at all.\n\nPardons are historically afforded to those accused of specific crimes – and usually those who have already been convicted of an offense — but Biden’s team is considering issuing them for those who have not even been investigated, let alone charged. They fear that Trump and his allies, who have boasted of enemies lists and exacting “retribution,” could launch investigations that would be reputationally and financially costly for their targets even if they don’t result in prosecutions.\n\nWhile the president’s pardon power is absolute, Biden’s use in this fashion would mark a significant expansion of how they are deployed, and some Biden aides fear it could lay the groundwork for an even more drastic usage by Trump. They also worry that issuing pardons would feed into claims by Trump and his allies that the individuals committed acts that necessitated immunity.\n\nRecipients could include infectious-disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was instrumental in combating the coronavirus pandemic and who has become a pariah to conservatives angry about mask mandates and vaccines. Others include witnesses in Trump’s criminal or civil trials and Biden administration officials who have drawn the ire of the incoming president and his allies.\n\nSome fearful former officials have reached out to the Biden White House preemptively seeking some sort of protection from the future Trump administration, one of the people said.\n\nIt follows Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter — not just for his convictions on federal gun and tax violations, but for any potential federal offense committed over an 11-year period, as the president feared that Trump allies would seek to prosecute his son for other offenses. That could serve as a model for other pardons Biden might issue to those who could find themselves in legal jeopardy under Trump.\n\nBiden is not the first to consider such pardons — Trump aides considered them for him and his supporters involved in his failed efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that culminated in a violent riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But he could be the first to issue them since Trump’s pardons never materialized before he left office nearly four years ago.\n\nGerald Ford granted a “full, free, and absolute pardon” in 1974 to his predecessor, Richard Nixon, over the Watergate scandal. He believed a potential trial would “cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States,” as written in the pardon proclamation.\n\nPolitico was first to report that Biden was studying the use of preemptive pardons.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump made no secret of his desire to seek revenge on those who prosecuted him or crossed him.\n\nTrump has talked about “enemies from within” and circulated social media posts that call for the jailing of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former Vice President Mike Pence and Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. He also zeroed in on former Rep. Liz Cheney, a conservative Republican who campaigned for Harris and helped investigate Jan. 6, and he promoted a social media post that suggested he wanted military tribunals for supposed treason.\n\nKash Patel, whom Trump has announced as his nominee to be director of the FBI, has listed dozens of former government officials he wanted to “come after.”\n\nRichard Painter, a Trump critic who served as the top White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said he was reluctantly in support of having Biden issue sweeping pardons to people who could be targeted by Trump’s administration. He said he hoped that would “clean the slate” for the incoming president and encourage him to focus on governing, not on punishing his political allies.\n\n“It’s not an ideal situation at all,” Painter said. “We have a whole lot of bad options confronting us at this point.”\n\nWhile the Supreme Court this year ruled that the president enjoys broad immunity from prosecution for what could be considered official acts, his aides and allies enjoy no such shield. Some fear that Trump could use the promise of a blanket pardon to encourage his allies to take actions they might otherwise resist for fear of running afoul of the law.\n\n“There could be blatant illegal conduct over the next four years, and he can go out and pardon his people before he leaves office,” Painter said. “But if he’s going to do that, he’s going to do that anyway regardless of what Biden does.”\n\nMore conventional pardons from Biden, such as those for sentencing disparities for people convicted of federal crimes, are expected before the end of the year, the White House said."

      "full_content": "Emmanuel Macron vows to name new French PM within days\n\nEPA\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he will name a new prime minister \"in the coming days\", after Michel Barnier resigned following a no-confidence vote in parliament. In a 10-minute address to the nation on Thursday, he rejected opposition pressure to stand down, vowing to stay in his post \"fully, until the end of the mandate\" in 2027. Macron was holding talks on Friday with leaders of the Socialists, who said they were ready for a compromise in forming a \"fixed-term\" government, but not under a prime minister from a right-wing party. The Socialists joined colleagues on the left and far right in voting to remove Michel Barnier on Wednesday, only three months after he was appointed by Macron.\n\nThe president thanked Barnier for his dedication during his brief term as prime minister, and accused MPs of collaborating in an \"anti-republican front\" to bring down the government. The vote was the first time a French government had been voted down by parliament in more than 60 years, a move Macron labelled \"unprecedented\". In France, it is the president who chooses the prime minister who then runs the government. But the prime minister must answer to parliament and Barnier lasted only three months before he was ousted in a no-confidence vote. Finding someone who will not be immediately rejected by parliament could be difficult for Macron, whose decision in June to call snap elections led to a deadlocked parliament. The National Assembly is now split into three big voting blocs - the left, centre and far right. If Macron's next choice of prime minister is to last, it is thought at least part of the left bloc will need to be persuaded to join the next government. The president held talks with several political leaders on Friday, having told the French people he would \"appoint in the coming days a prime minister who will form a government of general interest\". He first spoke to centrists in the \"Macron camp\", before meeting Socialist leaders, who are part of a broader left-wing bloc, the New Popular Front. He will also talk to the right-wing Republicans. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ahead of the talks that he was open to discussion and \"compromises on every issue\" towards forming a government based on a \"fixed term contract\". But he made clear he had little desire to \"ensure the continuity of Macronism\". No new parliamentary elections can be held until July 2025, which might explain Faure's remarks on being open to a limited term for the next government. Faure said after the talks Macron had \"absolutely not\" asked the Socialists to split from the wider New Popular Front (NFP). However, the biggest member of the NFP, the far-left France Unbowed, said Faure had been given no mandate to speak on the Popular Front's behalf."

Mr Penny pinned Jordan Neely, who was 30 at the time, down for several minutes on a New York City subway last year.

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nRomania’s constitutional court has annulled the first round of the country’s 2024 presidential election process, which was narrowly won by far-right ultranationalist candidate Calin Georgescu amid allegations of Russian interference.\n\nThe historic decision means a second-round runoff that was scheduled for Sunday, when Georgescu would have gone head to head with his centrist rival Elena Lasconi, will no longer take place.\n\nIn a press release, the court said the annulment was based on Article 146(f) of the Constitution, emphasizing the need to ensure the correctness and legality of the electoral process.\n\nThe court’s decision, announced Friday, is final and binding. It requires the Romanian government to restart the electoral calendar.\n\nFriday’s decision caps off a troubled election cycle in the country, with the same court last week ordering a recount of the first-round votes.\n\nIt also comes just days after the vote was hit with fears over foreign interference, after declassified documents from Romania’s top security council revealed evidence of “aggressive hybrid Russian attacks.”\n\nThey also showed how Georgescu was boosted by potential interference on TikTok – the social media platform on which he largely ran his campaign – through algorithms, coordinated accounts and paid promotion, Reuters reported.\n\nOne of the declassified documents, from the Romanian intelligence agency, detailed more than 85,000 attempted cyber-attacks on election websites and IT systems, and concluded that “the attacker has considerable resources specific to an attacking state,” Reuters reported.\n\nThese findings prompted the US State Department to express concern on Wednesday and warn that a shift away from the West “would have serious negative impacts on U.S. security cooperation with Romania.”\n\nIn a later statement Friday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: “The United States reaffirms our confidence in Romania’s democratic institutions and processes, including investigations into foreign malign influence.”\n\nPeople take part in a pro-Europe rally in Bucharest on December 5. Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images\n\nGeorgescu, 62, started his campaign with single-digit support but enjoyed a shock rise to prominence, narrowly emerging as leader in the election’s first round with 22.9% of the vote to Lasconi’s 19.2%.\n\nWhile he has not described himself as specifically pro-Russian, Georgescu had previously labeled Ukraine an “invented state” and declared he wants a strategy of “peace with everyone, regardless of who they are.”\n\nA Romanian official on Wednesday described Georgescu’s success in the first round as shocking. They told CNN that his victory would be “an extraordinary triumph for… (Russian President Vladimir) Putin” and “would cancel the whole progress that Romania has made in the past 35 years.”\n\nGeorgescu centered his campaign on tackling the country’s cost-of-living crisis, and vowed to end Romania’s support for Ukraine. Romania shares a 400-mile border with its northern neighbor and under its previous presidency helped export millions of tons of grain out of the war-stricken country.\n\nMeanwhile, the center-right Lasconi, of the Save Romania Union (USR) party, ran a campaign pledging to keep Romania on its pro-Western course.\n\nThe court’s decision to cancel the election came the day after a large protest in the Romanian capital Bucharest, when hundreds turned out to rally in favor of Lasconi and against the far right. A small group of counter-protesters also rallied in support of Georgescu on Thursday night.\n\nA Jandarmeria member closes a gate to the Palace of Parliament, after the Romanian top court annulled the result of the first round of the presidential election, in Bucharest on Friday.

      "full_content": "A mysterious, flu-like disease has killed dozens in the southwest region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with women and children among the most affected, health officials said Thursday. At least 376 cases have been reported since Oct. 24 of individuals experiencing fevers, headaches and runny noses, in addition to difficulty breathing and anemia, Jean Kaseya, director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in the agency’s weekly briefing.\n\nHealth officials have begun referring to the mysterious illness as “Disease X.” Africa CDC has recorded a total of 79 deaths caused by the illness, while local officials told Reuters that 143 have died. The numbers differ because the case definition is still unclear and some cases are still being confirmed, Margaret Muigai Edwin, communications director for Africa CDC, said in an email to The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe disease emerged in the Panzi health zone, Kaseya said, a remote, rural part of Kwango province along the border of Angola. The most affected age group is children under 5, with 198 cases reported — more than half of total cases.\n\nMalnutrition, from which 40 percent of the region suffers, may have played a role in making infected individuals more vulnerable to the disease, said Dieudonné Mwamba, director general of Congo’s National Public Health Institute, at the briefing.\n\nA breakdown in communication may have also contributed to the spread, Kaseya said. The first case was reported on Oct. 24, but it wasn’t until Sunday that authorities notified the national government. “That means we had a delay of almost five to six weeks,” Kaseya said. “In five to six weeks, so many things can happen.”\n\nA team of epidemiologists, lab experts and infection prevention and control workers from Africa CDC are now in the Kwango province hoping to identify the disease, Kaseya said. Officials are urging people to remain calm and vigilant and to prevent the spread of the disease by engaging in good hygiene practices and reporting any suspected cases to health officials, and to avoid mass gatherings and handling a deceased person’s remains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Health Organization will be sending medical professionals and supplies to aid in treatment of the disease, as well as in its identification, the organization said in a statement provided to The Washington Post. WHO officials cautioned against calling the disease “unidentified,” advising instead to describe it as “undiagnosed,” noting that the remote nature of the region — as well as its lack of laboratory services — may mean that what is infecting people may be an existing pathogen. Conflict, as well as the ongoing rainy season, has made it difficult to access the area, according to WHO.\n\nMedical professionals will also be testing for flu — it is peak flu season in the region, WHO said — as well as coronavirus, malaria and measles, in case the unknown disease may be multiple known diseases affecting the area."

      "full_content": "Bill Belichick, the legendary NFL coach who parted ways with the New England Patriots in January after 24 seasons and six Super Bowl victories, has had discussions with the University of North Carolina about its coaching job, three people with knowledge of the deliberations confirmed. It’s unclear how serious the interest between Belichick, who has been out of coaching and working in broadcasting this season, and North Carolina is. Some Belichick associates remain convinced that he is intent upon returning to an NFL sideline next season.\n\nNorth Carolina is seeking a successor to Mack Brown after firing him last week. According to one of the people familiar with the discussions, Belichick is among several candidates who have spoken to school officials in informal conversations conducted virtually. The school’s search has not yet progressed to formal interviews, according to that person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo other people confirmed Belichick’s talks with the school but expressed skepticism that the discussions will lead to him accepting the Tar Heels job, given their belief that Belichick hopes to coach in the NFL in 2025.\n\nSkip to end of carousel The Sports Moment newsletter (The Washington Post) Reporter Ava Wallace takes you through the buzziest, most engaging sports stories of the week. Sign up for the weekly newsletter End of carousel\n\nSchool officials declined to comment. The website Inside Carolina first reported that Belichick spoke with North Carolina.\n\nBelichick will turn 73 in April. He interviewed twice with the Atlanta Falcons last offseason after parting with the Patriots and spoke with the Washington Commanders. But the Falcons hired Raheem Morris. The Commanders hired Dan Quinn. And Belichick, perhaps the greatest coach in league history, was shut out in the NFL hiring cycle.\n\nHe could be in greater demand this offseason. Three NFL teams have already fired their coaches: the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints and Chicago Bears. Several other coaches, including the Dallas Cowboys’ Mike McCarthy and the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Doug Pederson, have been under intense scrutiny while their teams have struggled. McCarthy’s contract expires after the season, although the Cowboys have won two straight games and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has said he is not ruling out the possibility of retaining McCarthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Giants co-owner John Mara has said that he intends to be more patient and does not plan to fire Coach Brian Daboll or General Manager Joe Schoen either during the season or after it. But the Giants’ ongoing issues have led to speculation that a change still could be made. Belichick probably would be a strong candidate for the Jaguars, Cowboys and Giants if they have head coaching vacancies, and he also could be considered by the Bears.\n\nBelichick has 333 coaching victories in the NFL, counting the postseason, putting him 14 shy of Don Shula’s career record of 347. His 302 regular season wins put him 26 behind Shula’s 328. If he takes a college coaching job, Belichick probably will be passing up the opportunity to catch Shula.\n\nThe Patriots went 4-13 in 2023 in Belichick’s final season. They went 29-38 and made the playoffs only once in Belichick’s last four seasons after quarterback Tom Brady left the team via free agency following the 2019 season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelichick has never coached at the college level. His father, Steve, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy.\n\nThe Tar Heels went 6-6 this season. Their interim coach is Freddie Kitchens, the former coach of the Cleveland Browns. Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, the former coach of the Falcons, is a North Carolina alum and also has been linked to the job. Smith has said that the school contacted him in what he termed a preliminary call, adding that the job is not his focus and he’s happy in Pittsburgh."

      "full_content": "More rumors have surfaced not only regarding Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal and release timing, but also the apparent port of Kirby: Planet Robobot on Nintendo’s current console.\n\nToday’s speculation comes from the Nate the Hate podcast. NateDrake, who’s name has been out there before with Nintendo rumors and the industry as a whole, held discussion pointing to a possible Nintendo Switch 2 reveal between the second half of January and early February. Given that an announcement is expected by the end of the fiscal year ending March 2025, that’s not too surprising. Nintendo’s next financial results briefing is also planned for February 4.\n\nNateDrake goes on to say that he’s heard an event will be held for Nintendo Switch 2 in May. The console itself is apparently targeting a late May to June release, based on industry chatter.\n\nThat’s not the only rumor we have here. For the current Nintendo Switch, we’re apparently getting a Kirby: Planet Robobot port in 2025. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, another game that was originally on Nintendo 3DS, received the same treatment a few months ago. It’s unclear if Planet Robobot would be a fairly straightforward port in HD, or if extra content would be brought to the table.\n\nJust like with all rumors, nothing is confirmed until Nintendo itself comes forward. That being said, you can listen to the full podcast here.\n\nShare this:\n\nRelated"

      "full_content": "Dick Van Dyke is the star of Coldplay‘s music video for the band’s latest single, “All My Love,” which sees the 98-year-old Hollywood legend dancing barefoot and duetting with frontman Chris Martin.\n\nDirected by Spike Jonze and Mary Wigmore, the seven-minute video is more like a short film as Van Dyke — who turns 99 on Dec. 13 — reflects on his nearly eight-decade career. The Golden Globe, Tony and Emmy winner is best known for starring in the movie musicals “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Mary Poppins” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” — and he proves in the “All My Love” music video that he still has the moves that made him famous. At one point, he even breaks out his signature bowler hat.\n\nShot at Van Dyke’s Malibu home, the video interweaves footage of Van Dyke, his family and Martin in his backyard with archival photographs and interview clips. “I’m acutely aware that I could go any day now,” Van Dyke said. “But I don’t know why it doesn’t concern me. I’m not afraid of it. I have that feeling, totally against anything intellectual, that I’m going to be alright.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHe continued that he considers himself “one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway. Think how lucky I am. I got to do what I do — play and act silly.”\n\nVan Dyke’s extended family then joins him in the backyard to exchange hugs and cheers, including his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. At the end of the video, as the credits roll, Martin freestyles a song about old age for Van Dyke as he looks on with joy and fascination.\n\n“Do you believe this man?” Van Dyke asks the camera operators. “He just wrote a song!”\n\nWatch the full music video for “All My Love” below."

They were playing in the playground at the Oroville school when the suspect opened fire, the sheriff said.\n\nButte County Sheriff's Office\n\nHonea said Roman was shot twice and had internal injuries and Elias was shot once in the abdomen. They are still being treated for their gunshot wounds and will need several surgeries, according to the sheriff.\n\n\"They have a very long road ahead of them,\" he told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n\nHonea stressed that the investigation was ongoing but revealed the identity of the shooter, his decades of criminal history and some clues into his motive behind the incident.\n\nGlenn Litton, 56, called the school, which is affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, several days ago using an alias to set up an appointment with the principal, according to the sheriff. Litton claimed that he was looking to enroll a grandchild at the school. The shooter, who was homeless, has no grandchildren, according to Honea.\n\n\"It appears to us that story was a ruse so he could set up an appointment so he had access to the campus,\" he told reporters.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, the shooter walked to the playground of the school, brandished a handgun and opened fire. The shooter took his own life, according to investigators.\n\nPolice were called and a California Highway Patrol trooper was the first to arrive on the scene, finding the two wounded students and the suspect's body. The boys were quickly rushed to hospitals.\n\nThe suspect had a long criminal history with arrests dating back to when he was a child, according to local investigators and the FBI, which is assisting in the investigation. The suspect spent several stints in state and federal prisons for various crimes including forgery, investigators said.\n\nIn the last year, the shooter had been charged with new counts in both California and Arizona. In March, he was accused of stealing cash from a CVS in Phoenix where he worked a few days, investigators said.\n\nLast month, the shooter was released from a San Bernardino County jail after he was arrested for stealing a U-Haul. He pleaded not guilty, was released on his own recognizance and was picked up by a relative, the sheriff said.\n\nHonea said that the shooter lived in motels in Chico and Sacramento in the two weeks before he took a bus and an Uber to the school.\n\nThe shooter attended a Seventh-day Adventist School in Paradise, California, many years ago and had a relative who attended the targeted school many years ago, investigators said. However, investigators said there is no current connection between the school and the suspect.\n\nThe shooter did look up another Seventh-day Adventist school in the area and had suspicious notes that mentioned the church, according to Honea.\n\nInvestigators said they uncovered writings by the shooter that made unverified claims the school was linked with matters concerning the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Honea said there is no indication that the shooter's claims are true.\n\n\"He had significant mental health issues and pulled information from various sources and it all pulled together to form a reality that is false,\" the sheriff said.\n\nInvestigators said that as a convicted felon, the shooter could not legally have a firearm and it appeared the weapon used in the shooting was a ghost gun. Investigators are still looking for clues and are in contact with the suspect's sister but noted that he did not have close relations with his family.\n\nThe school, which teaches kindergarten to 8th grade and has a total of 35 students, remains closed and counselors have been made available to the students and staff, according to Laurie Trujillo, a spokeswoman for the Northern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.\n\nTrujillo held back tears as she talked about the pain and trauma that the school and church community are enduring and asked for people of all faiths to send their prayers.\n\n\"We know the close-knit Feather Day community will be grieving for a long time,\" she said.\n\nA candlelight vigil is scheduled for Friday in honor of the victims."

      "full_content": "Week 14 of the 2024 NFL season is underway after a thriller on \"Thursday Night Football\" in which the Detroit Lions hung on to defeat the Green Bay Packers 34-31 with a buzzer-beating field goal.\n\nCould the rest of Week 14 be just as exciting? Here is how the remaining Week 14 slate could unfold with increased levels of stunning outcomes in our latest iteration of our CBS Sports bold predictions.\n\n1. Chargers snap six-game losing streak vs. Chiefs\n\nJustin Herbert LAC • QB • #10 CMP% 63.4 YDs 2551 TD 13 INT 1 YD/Att 7.59 View Profile\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have been the bogeyman of the AFC West since they are on the precipice of clinching their ninth consecutive division title for the second-longest division title winning streak in NFL history. Only the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick New England Patriots dynasty teams (11 in a row from 2009-2019) have a longer such streak.\n\nHowever, the Los Angeles Chargers will deny the Chiefs a party at Arrowhead Stadium Sunday night by snapping a six-game losing streak against the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Patrick Mahomes and Co. have been begging to lose week in and week out despite starting 11-1 in 2024. They have the worst point differential (+54) by a team starting 11-1 or better in NFL history, per CBS Sports Research, and they have won 75% of their games (9 of 12) by seven or fewer points. That's the most of any team in NFL history through 12 games.\n\nPlaying like that against the Chargers No. 1 scoring defense, which is allowing an NFL-low 15.7 points per game, and quarterback Justin Herbert, who leads the NFL in touchdown to interception ratio (13 to 1) is asking for trouble. Having a quarterback who has gone over 300 consecutive pass attempts without an interception, 305 to be exact, and the league's top scoring defense is a winning formula. It's also a formula that will knock off a Chiefs team daring another squad, outside of the Buffalo Bills, to beat them.\n\n2. Rams stun Bills to snap Buffalo's seven-game winning streak\n\nMatthew Stafford LAR • QB • #9 CMP% 66.0 YDs 2983 TD 17 INT 7 YD/Att 7.29 View Profile\n\nLos Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford found his groove. He threw nine touchdowns to seven interceptions in the Rams first nine games of the year, but the last three weeks, two of which have resulted in Los Angeles victories, Stafford has thrown for eight touchdowns and no picks.\n\nOn the other side of this Week 14 matchup in Los Angeles, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is playing the most efficient football of his career in 2024 with career-lows in turnover rate (1.8%) and sack rate (3.5%) to go along with his shortest average pass length (7.6) and quickest time to throw (2.83 seconds) of his career. However, he will get heated up by Rams rookie edge rusher Jared Verse, whose 55 quarterback pressures rank as the fourth-most in the NFL, and the rest of the youth along Los Angeles first or second-year pass rush in Byron Young (six sacks), Braden Fiske (six sacks) and Kobie Turner (five sacks).\n\nStafford and the Rams youthful pass rush combine to snap the Bills seven-game winning streak in Week 14.\n\n3. Cardinals snap six-game losing streak vs. Seahawks\n\nKyler Murray ARI • QB • #1 CMP% 68.7 YDs 2603 TD 13 INT 6 YD/Att 7.27 View Profile\n\nSeattle has won six in a row against the Cardinals, including three straight in Arizona, but that streak ends on Sunday when the Cardinals secure a crucial home win to reclaim first place in the NFC West.\n\nEntering their Week 11 bye, the Cardinals were soaring and on a four-game winning streak. That had them out to a 6-4 record and sole ownership of first place out in the NFC West. They have since lost their last two games with a 16-6 defeat at the Seattle Seahawks in Week 12 and a deflating 23-22 road loss at the Minnesota Vikings, a game in which they led 19-6 late in the third quarter.\n\nQuarterback Kyler Murray's ball security has slipped during the slide with three interceptions in the past two games after only throwing three in the team's first 10 games in 2024. Arizona needs the efficient version Murray to return in addition to his explosive dual threat ability: the Cardinals are 5-0 when he has at least two total touchdowns in a game, and they are 1-6 when he has one total touchdown or less.\n\n\n\nMurray has started to find the team's fourth overall pick Marvin Harrison Jr. more and more of late: he's caught three touchdowns in his last five games while averaging 61.2 receiving yards per game after catching four in the team's first seven games while averaging 42.9 receiving yards per game. Arizona tight end Trey McBride is currently producing at a clip not previously seen by a tight end in the modern NFL: he is the only tight end since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger with consecutive games with at least 12 catches. Oddly enough, he has yet to catch a touchdown this season despite having the third-most receptions by a tight end this season (73) and the second-most receiving yards by a tight end this season (781).\n\nYes, the Seahawks defense has started to cook the last three weeks, but Murray and Co. will overcome Mike Macdonald's coalescing unit to win their first game against Seattle in Seven tries.\n\nSeahawks defense, last three games\n\n\n\n\n\nNFL Rank PPG Allowed 14.7 2nd Plays of 25+ Yards Allowed 1 1st Yards/Play Allowed 4.8 4th\n\n4. Saints WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling catches receiving TD of 25 or more yards in fourth consecutive game at Giants\n\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling NO • WR • #10 TAR 20 REC 10 REC YDs 263 REC TD 4 FL 0 View Profile\n\nSince entering the New Orleans Saints starting lineup in Week 9 after being released by the Buffalo Bills, wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling has been electrifying. He is the second player in Saints history with four receiving touchdowns in his first four games with the team, joining Donte' Stallworth per CBS Sports Research. MVS is also one of only three players with a receiving touchdown of 25 or more yards in three consecutive games this season along with Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase and Tennessee Titans wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.\n\nDespite facing a Giants defense that has surrendered only two receiving touchdowns of 25 or more air yards this season, tied for the 10th-fewest in the NFL, Valdes-Scantling will run his streak to five games in a row on Sunday in MetLife Stadium.\n\n5. Steelers All-Pro T.J. Watt fails to record a sack vs. Browns\n\nJameis Winston CLE • QB • #5 CMP% 61.3 YDs 1763 TD 11 INT 7 YD/Att 7.67 View Profile\n\nPittsburgh Steelers All-Pro edge rusher T.J. Watt is one of the best pass rushers in NFL history. He is first all-time in sacks per game, averaging just under one a game (0.91). However, he will go sackless in the rematch against Jameis Winston just like he did two weeks ago in Week 12, a bold prediction given Watt's historic pass rush production.\n\nWinston plays to the beat of his own drum: he is the only player in NFL history with multiple games of 400 or more passing yards, four or more passing touchdowns and three or more interceptions in his career with his latest one coming last week in a 41-32 loss at the Denver Broncos. His unorthodox movements will allow him to stunningly evade Watt's clutches for the second time this season."

      "full_content": "WASHINGTON — A Vega C successfully launched an Earth observation satellite Dec. 5 in the rocket’s first flight since a failure nearly two years ago.\n\nThe Vega C lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 4:20 p.m. Eastern. The launch was previously scheduled for Dec. 4 but delayed a day because a problem with the mobile launch gantry at the pad.\n\nThe three solid-fuel lower stages of the Vega C performed as expected, followed by three burns by the liquid-propellant AVUM+ upper stage. That upper stage deployed its payload, the Sentinel-1C satellite, about one hour and 45 minutes after liftoff.\n\nThe launch was the first for the Vega C since a December 2022 launch failure on the rocket’s second flight that destroyed two Pléiades Neo imaging satellites. That failure was blamed on the nozzle on the Zefiro-40 motor in the rocket’s second stage. Avio, the prime contractor for the Vega C, first replaced the carbon-carbon material in the nozzle, but the nozzle failed in a June 2023 static-fire test, leading to a redesign of the nozzle itself.\n\nThe redesigned motor completed two static-fire tests in May and October, giving Avio, launch services company Arianespace and the European Space Agency confidence that the problem was corrected. The motor performed as expected on this flight.\n\nThe payload, Sentinel-1C, is a radar imaging satellite built by Thales Alenia Space for the Copernicus program of Earth observation missions run by ESA and the European Commission. It replaces the Sentinel-1B spacecraft that malfunctioned in orbit nearly three years ago. It joins the existing, but aging, Sentinel-1A satellite and includes new capabilities to monitor maritime traffic with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) receiver.\n\n“One moment combined two great European achievements today: the third launch of a Sentinel-1 satellite and the third launch of Vega C, marking a triumphant return to form for both flagship European projects,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said in a statement after the launch.\n\nThe Vega C return to flight was particularly significant since its earlier failure, coupled with the retirement of the Ariane 5 and delays in the introduction of the Ariane 6, led to what Aschbacher and others called a “launcher crisis” in Europe. That forced ESA and the EU to turn to SpaceX for Falcon 9 launches of key science and navigation spacecraft.\n\n“Today’s launch marks a crucial step forward, reaffirming European independent access to space,” said Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA’s director of space transportation, in a post-launch statement. “With Vega C back in flight and the inaugural launch of Ariane 6 in July, we are in a great place going forward.”\n\nFour Vega C launches are planned for 2025, which will be the last with Arianespace as the launch services provider for the rocket. It is transitioning that responsibility to Avio, which has already taken over sales and marketing of the rocket.\n\n“We are once again proud to contribute to the European Copernicus program and more broadly to an independent access to space for Europe through our launchers,” Giulio Ranzo, chief executive of Avio, said in a statement. “With Vega C, we are ready to deliver our customers’ payloads to orbit with a scheduled increase in launch cadence for the upcoming years.”\n\nWith a mostly successful first launch of the Ariane 6 — a malfunction prevented the upper stage from performing a final deorbit burn — and the return to flight of Vega C, ESA and launch companies are now focusing on increasing flight rates. A second Ariane 6 was originally scheduled for late this year, but Arianespace announced a month ago that it would be delayed to mid-February.\n\nThe delay, Arianespace said at the time, would not affect the schedule of future launches, and company executives had previously projected six Ariane 6 launches in 2025. “Following this success and that of the inaugural flight of Ariane 6,” Stéphane Israël, chief executive of Arianespace, said after the Vega C launch, “Arianespace is preparing for a high level of activity in 2025.”\n\nThat high level of activity is a relative matter. By contrast, SpaceX has performed more than 120 launches of its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches so far this year."

The game’s early access period for Premium Edition and Collector’s Edition buyers launches at 7PM ET today, but full ray tracing won’t be added until December 9th, when the game launches for everyone else.\n\n“Following the release of the update, shadows, reflections, and global illumination will all be accurately rendered in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using Full Ray Tracing, elevating image quality,” Nvidia says in a blog post. And DLSS Ray Reconstruction will be “coming soon,” according to an emailed media alert.\n\nThe belated addition of the graphics options could sting for early access buyers, especially given that early access isn’t cheap: the Premium Edition, for example, costs $99.99, a $30 increase over the game’s standard $69.99 price.\n\nThe game already has hefty PC specs, including that GPU hardware ray tracing is required even at minimum. Jim Kjellin, the CTO of Great Circle developer MachineGames, gave us a reason for as to why that’s the case:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle uses a technique called global illumination to light the environment and characters. Our engine MOTOR, used by MachineGames, uses hardware raytracing to calculate this. While this isn’t what players may typically think of as “ray tracing,” the compatible hardware is required to do this is in a performant, high fidelity way."

      "full_content": "Armed with a weighted net, a three-pointed trident and a dagger, the retiarius – or fisherman gladiator – was a familiar sight in Rome’s ancient arenas. Their survival depended on swiftly ensnaring heavily armoured opponents with the specially designed nets.\n\nSurprisingly, certain spiders employ a strikingly similar technique. Slingshot spiders (Theridiosoma gemmosum), also known as ray spiders, create a unique trap by pulling the centre of their flat web into a cone, holding it taut with a single anchor thread.\n\nWhen prey approaches, they release the thread, propelling the web forward like a catapult to entangle their target in its sticky threads.\n\nIn 2021, researchers Saad Bahmla (Georgia Institute of Technology, USA) and Todd Blackledge (University of Akron, USA) discovered that these spiders could be prompted to deploy their ballistic webs simply by the sound of a finger snap. Could these arachnids actually be listening for their prey, releasing their nets even before the unsuspecting victims touch the web?\n\nVintage illustration of Victorian reenactment of fisherman gladiators at Earl's court in 1888/Getty\n\nTo investigate, Blackledge and his colleague Sarah Han conducted experiments to test the spiders’ sensitivity to sound. Their findings, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, revealed that slingshot spiders indeed appear to ‘hear’ their prey, timing their web launches to intercept insects as they come within range.\n\n“Slingshot spiders are really tiny, so they can be quite hard to find,” explains Han, recalling hours spent looking for their distinctive cone-shaped webs along riverbanks at several locations in the Summit Metro Parks of Ohio, USA. “It does take some time to develop the eye for them,” she admits.\n\nOnce Han had collected the spiders, she recreated their natural environment in the lab, providing twigs for web-building and hunting down mosquitoes to serve as bait.\n\nA slingshot spider prepares its web for an attack/Han, S. I. and Blackledge, T. A\n\nThe results were fascinating. When a mosquito came close, the spiders released their webs to capture it – but the insects didn’t actually need to make contact with the web.\n\nThe spiders could launch their nets before any physical impact occurred. Intrigued, Han used a tuning fork tuned to mimic the sound of mosquito wings and found the spiders responded just the same, hurling their webs forward at the phantom insect. This indicated that the spiders were detecting sound, likely with the sensitive hairs on their legs, to identify the presence of prey.\n\nThe speed of these attacks is astounding, says Han, who calculated that the spiders’ webs accelerate at a staggering 50g (504m/s²), reaching velocities close to 1m/s and intercepting their target in just 38 milliseconds – far too fast for the prey to escape.\n\nMoreover, the spiders displayed remarkable precision: they were much more likely to release their webs when a mosquito was directly in front (76%) compared to when it was behind the web (29%).\n\nHan and Blackledge suggest the spiders may compare vibrations transmitted through their web with those carried through the air to determine the insect’s position, ensuring their strikes hit the mark.\n\nThese remarkable little hunters demonstrate a level of ingenuity and precision worthy of their gladiator-like reputation, proving that even the tiniest predators have evolved some of the most extraordinary strategies in the natural world.\n\nFind out more about the study: Directional web strikes are performed by ray spiders in response to airborne prey vibrations\n\nMore wildlife stories from around the world:"

      "full_content": "Two spacecraft developed by the European Space Agency launched on top of an Indian rocket Thursday, kicking off a mission to test novel formation flying technologies and observe a rarely seen slice of the Sun's ethereal corona.\n\nESA's Proba-3 mission is purely experimental. The satellites are loaded with sophisticated sensors and ranging instruments to allow the two spacecraft to orbit the Earth in lockstep with one another. Proba-3 will attempt to achieve millimeter-scale precision, several orders of magnitude better than the requirements for a spacecraft closing in for docking at the International Space Station.\n\n\"In a nutshell, it’s an experiment in space to demonstrate a new concept, a new technology that is technically challenging,\" said Damien Galano, Proba-3's project manager.\n\nThe two Proba-3 satellites launched from India at 5:34 am EST (10:34 UTC) Thursday, riding a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The PSLV released Proba-3 into a stretched-out orbit with a low point of approximately 356 miles (573 kilometers), a high point of 37,632 miles (60,563 kilometers), and an inclination of 59 degrees to the equator.\n\nCredit: ISRO India's PSLV accelerates through the speed of sound shortly after liftoff with the Proba-3 mission Thursday.\n\nAfter initial checkouts, the two Proba-3 satellites, each smaller than a compact car, will separate from one another to begin their tech demo experiments early next year. The larger of the two satellites, known as the Coronagraph spacecraft, carries a suite of science instruments to image the Sun's corona, or outer atmosphere. The smaller spacecraft, named Occulter, hosts navigation sensors and low-impulse thrusters to help it maneuver into position less than 500 feet (150 meters) from its Coronagraph companion.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Coronagraph spacecraft, this is just the right distance for a 4.6-foot (1.4-meter) disk mounted to Proba-3's Occulter spacecraft to obscure the surface of the Sun. The occultation will block the Sun's blinding glare and cast a shadow just 3 inches (8 centimeters) onto the Coronagraph satellite, revealing the wispy, super-heated gases that make up the solar corona."
