      "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $ 35 billion proposal from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe rule, unveiled Tuesday by the Health and Human Services Department, would require Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound for a large segment of Americans who are obese.\n\nBut it’s unclear if the proposal, which would not go into effect until after Trump takes office, will have support from his new administration — including from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an opponent of the drugs whom the president-elect has tapped to serve as head of HHS.\n\nHere’s what to know about the drugs and the Biden administration’s proposal:\n\nThe drugs work by regulating appetites\n\nThe weight-loss drugs, also called anti-obesity medications or GLP-1s, mimic the hormone known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which regulates appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.\n\nThe drugs include Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic as well as Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n\nIn clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight — up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But a slice of “nonresponders” did not lose significant body weight.\n\nPrivate health insurers have limited coverage of the drugs. Medicare has been barred from covering them under a law that says the program cannot pay for weight-loss products. Coverage through Medicaid, meanwhile, has varied from state to state.\n\nThat’s meant the drugs — which can cost upwards of $1,000 monthly — have been largely unaffordable for many.\n\nIt would benefit millions, but cost billions\n\nThe rule announced Tuesday affects Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for roughly 70 million of the nation’s poorest people, and Medicare, the health insurance program for about 67 million older Americans.\n\nUnder the proposal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, would reinterpret the federal law, to consider the drugs as a treatment for obesity diseases.\n\nThe nation’s top health agency estimates as many as 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.\n\nAnd the proposal would cost a lot of money — at least $35 billion over the next decade.\n\nIt’s not clear if Trump will support it\n\nThe drugs are popular — with a majority of Americans telling health firm KFF in a poll earlier this year that Medicare should cover the drugs. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, too, has lobbied for coverage of the drugs.\n\nBut support is mixed in Trump’s inner circle.\n\nKennedy has railed against the idea of Medicare or Medicaid covering the drugs. Instead, he’s told Congress that they should expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships through the government-sponsored health care programs.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is poised to take the helm of CMS, has said the drugs can be a helpful tool. In a video posted to Instagram last year, Oz praised some of the benefits of the drugs, but said the long-term effects should be further studied.\n\n“I think these new generation of medications offer us a huge opportunity,” Oz said.\n\nTrump or Kennedy could ultimately ignore Biden’s proposal and not implement it.\n\nSome lawmakers praised the move on Tuesday, while others expressed skepticism.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican who sponsored a bill to have Medicare cover the weight-loss drugs, has argued that covering the drugs and other obesity treatments could save taxpayers in the long run.\n\n“I am encouraged to see the Administration support our efforts to help make Americans healthier by allowing Medicare coverage of new, physician prescribed and FDA approved anti-obesity medications,” Wenstrup said in a statement.\n\nHe called for the Congress to pass a law that would help pay for dietitians, nutritionists and behavioral therapy to treat obesity.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, however, warned that unless the government required drugmakers to lower the price of the medications Medicare premiums would “skyrocket” under the plan.\n\nDoctors praise the drugs, but still have concerns\n\nIt’s good for more Americans to have access to these drugs, which have proven effective, but Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition and obesity expert at Harvard University, hopes that it doesn’t become the primary way obesity is treated in America.\n\nHe worries that not enough investment is being made to figure out what is driving climbing obesity rates across the U.S., and the role that healthy foods and exercise might play in solving that epidemic.\n\n“It’s appropriate to treat the problems that we now face with drugs, but let’s not stop there,” Ludwig said. “Let’s identify what’s causing the problem, and ultimately rely on these drugs — which have side effects — less and less over time.”\n\nDr. Andrew Kraftson, who treats obese patients at the University of Michigan, is happy that more of his patients might be able to afford these drugs, which he has prescribed for patients and has had successful results. But he, too, would like to see more research and guidance from the government on prescribing the medications.\n\nKraftson also worries about some of the side effects for elderly patients. The drugs, he points out, can lead to muscle loss, which is a bigger problem for older Americans who are at risk of falling, for example.\n\n“I’m advocating for their thoughtful use,” Kraftson said. “Because if you have a senior and you just write a prescription and the visit takes five minutes, is that an appropriate level of care? Have we defined that well?"

      "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to records Tuesday after Donald Trump’s latest talk about tariffs created only some ripples on Wall Street, even if they could roil the global economy were they to take effect.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to top the all-time high it set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 123 points, or 0.3%, to its own record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6% as Microsoft and Big Tech led the way.\n\nStock markets abroad mostly fell after President-elect Trump said he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China once he takes office. But the movements were mostly modest. Stock indexes were down 0.1% in Shanghai and nearly flat in Hong Kong, while Canada’s main index edged down by less than 0.1%.\n\nTrump has often praised the use of tariffs, but investors are weighing whether his latest threat will actually become policy or is just an opening point for negotiations. For now, the market seems to be taking it more as the latter.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street hangs near its records despite tariff talk The AP’s Seth Sutel reports Wall Street hangs near its records despite tariff talk.\n\nThe consequences otherwise for markets and the global economy could be painful.\n\nUnless the United States can prepare alternatives for the autos, energy products and other goods that come from Mexico, Canada and China, such tariffs would raise the price of imported items all at once and make households poorer, according to Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi, economists at High Frequency Economics.\n\nThey would also hurt profit margins for U.S. companies, while raising the threat of retaliatory tariffs by other countries. And unlike tariffs in Trump’s first term, his latest proposal would affect products across the board.\n\nGeneral Motors sank 9%, and Ford Motor fell 2.6% because both import automobiles from Mexico. Constellation Brands, which sells Modelo and other Mexican beer brands in the United States, dropped 3.3%. The value of the Mexican peso fell 1.8% against the U.S. dollar.\n\nBeyond the pain such tariffs would cause U.S. households and businesses, they could also push the Federal Reserve to slow or even halt its cuts to interest rates. The Fed had just begun easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high a couple months ago to offer support for the job market. While lower interest rates can boost the economy, they can also offer more fuel for inflation.\n\n“Many” officials at the Fed’s last meeting earlier this month said they should lower rates gradually, according to minutes of the meeting released Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe talk about tariffs overshadowed another mixed set of profit reports from U.S. retailers that answered few questions about how much more shoppers can keep spending. They’ll need to stay resilient after helping the economy avoid a recession, despite the high interest rates imposed by the Fed to get inflation under control.\n\nA report on Tuesday from the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved in November, but not by as much as economists expected.\n\nKohl’s tumbled 17% after its results for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Tom Kingsbury said sales remain soft for apparel and footwear. A day earlier, Kingsbury said he plans to step down as CEO in January. Ashley Buchanan, CEO of Michaels and a retail veteran, will replace him.\n\nBest Buy fell 4.9% after likewise falling short of analysts’ expectations. Dick’s Sporting Goods topped forecasts for the latest quarter thanks to a strong back-to-school season, but its stock lost an early gain to fall 1.4%.\n\nStill, more stocks rose in the S&P 500 than fell. J.M. Smucker had one of the biggest gains and climbed 5.7% after topping analysts’ expectations for the latest quarter. CEO Mark Smucker credited strength for its Uncrustables, Meow Mix, Café Bustelo and Jif brands.\n\nBig Tech stocks also helped prop up U.S. indexes. Gains of 3.2% for Amazon and 2.2% for Microsoft were the two strongest forces lifting the S&P 500.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 34.26 points to 6,021.63. The Dow gained 123.74 to 44,860.31, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 119.46 to 19,174.30.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady following their big drop from a day before driven by relief following Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury inched up to 4.29% from 4.28% late Monday, but it’s still well below the 4.41% level where it ended last week.\n\nIn the crypto market, bitcoin continued to pull back after topping $99,000 for the first time late last week. It’s since dipped back toward $91,000, according to CoinDesk.\n\nIt’s a sharp turnaround from the bonanza that initially took over the crypto market following Trump’s election. That boom had also appeared to have spilled into some corners of the stock market. Strategists at Barclays Capital pointed to stocks of unprofitable companies, along with other areas that can be caught up in bursts of optimism by smaller-pocketed “retail” investors.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

      "full_content": "Nordstrom on Tuesday beat Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations, as revenue grew about 4% year over year from shoppers buying clothing, shoes and activewear at both the company's namesake department store and its off-price chain.\n\nYet despite its better-than-expected quarter, the Seattle-based retailer gave only a slightly rosier full-year sales forecast — taking a conservative stance as it gears up for the busiest weeks of the holiday season. The company said it now expects full-year revenue, which includes retail sales and credit card revenue, to range from flat to up 1% for the full year. That compares to its previous range of a 1% decline to 1% growth. However, it stuck by its adjusted earnings outlook for the year of between $1.75 and $2.05 per share.\n\nIn a news release, CEO Erik Nordstorm said the company's results show efforts to appeal to selective shoppers are paying off. Sales of women's apparel and activewear shot up by double digits year over year. Shoes, men's apparel and kids grew by mid-to-high single digits year over year.\n\nCompared with the second quarter, women's apparel, shoes and men's apparel sales in the fiscal third quarter also grew sequentially.\n\n\"Our customers have a lot of choices, and our results give us encouragement that we're on the right path,\" he said. \"Looking ahead, we'll continue to improve our shopping experience as we strive to maintain the positive momentum we've worked towards all year.\"\n\nOn the company's earnings call, however, he said Nordstrom saw \"a noticeable decline in sales trends towards the end of October.\" It factored that slowdown into its holiday expectations, he said.\n\nHere is how Nordstrom did in the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 compared to what Wall Street anticipated, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable with analysts' estimates\n\n33 cents adjusted, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable with analysts' estimates Revenue: $3.46 billion vs. $3.35 billion expected\n\nNordstrom's net income for the fiscal third quarter was $46 million, or 27 cents per share, compared with $67 million, or 41 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose from $3.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAfter excluding a charge related to accelerated depreciation of technology, Nordstrom reported adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents.\n\nComparable sales increased 4% across Nordstrom's two brands, its namesake and its off-price chain, Nordstrom Rack. That easily topped analysts' expectations for 0.7% gains in comparable sales, according to StreetAccount.\n\nNordstrom's sales growth, while modest, is notable at a time when sales of discretionary merchandise and the luxury category have been under pressure. Retailers including Walmart, Best Buy and Target have reported over the past week that customers remain choosy when it comes to buying items that are wants, not needs, and have paid more attention to price.\n\nNordstrom's sales growth also grew, despite a calendar shift with its Anniversary Sale. In the year-ago quarter, eight days of the sale fell into the three-month period, but only one day fell in the quarter this year. That had a negative impact on net sales of about 1%.\n\nMacy's, which postponed its full earnings, said third-quarter sales fell 2.4% and comparable sales for its owned and licensed businesses plus online marketplace dropped 1.3%,\n\nNordstrom has leaned on its off-price chain, Nordstrom Rack, to drive both sales growth and new store locations. Yet in the third quarter, the two banners reported similar comparable sales – with the namesake store's up 4% and Nordstrom Rack up 3.9%.\n\nSo far this year, Nordstrom has opened 23 new Nordstrom Rack stores, which lines up with the company's plans to open 20 to 25 new Racks per year.\n\nAt the end of the quarter, the company launched store fulfillment for online orders at Nordstrom Rack in over 100 stores across the country, CEO Erik Nordstrom said on the company's earnings call. He said the company also launched a new feature which allows customers to buy online and pickup in store, at the same stores.\n\nDigital sales rose 6.4% year over year and in the quarter, e-commerce accounted for about a third of total sales.\n\nErik Nordstrom said the company added better search and discovery features to its website and app, which supported online growth in the quarter. He said it also added more items that are under $100 in price and expanded its third-party marketplace business, which now has over 300 sellers.\n\nNordstrom's latest quarterly update comes about two months after Nordstrom's founding family made a fresh bid to take the company private. According to a filing in September, CEO Erik Nordstrom, President Peter Nordstrom and Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool sent a non-binding letter to form an entity that would buy the chain for $23 per share.\n\nShares of the company have shot up since a Reuters report in March that Nordstrom's founding family wanted to take the company private. As of Tuesday's close, the company's stock has risen 32% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gains."

      "full_content": "'No-one will win' - Canada, Mexico and China respond to Trump tariff threats\n\nGetty Images\n\nOfficials from Canada, Mexico and China have warned US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to impose sweeping tariffs on America's three largest trading partners could upend the economies of all four countries. \"To one tariff will follow another in response and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,\" Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said. Trump vowed on Monday night to introduce 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on goods coming from China. He said the duties were a bid to clamp down on drugs and illegal immigration. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he spoke to Trump in the hours after the announcement and planned to hold a meeting with Canada's provincial leaders on Wednesday to discuss a response.\n\nA spokesman for China's embassy in Washington DC told the BBC: \"No-one will win a trade war or a tariff war.” The international pushback came a day after Trump announced his plans for his first day in office, on 20 January, in a post on his social media website, Truth Social. Trudeau said his country was prepared to work with the US in \"constructive ways\". \"This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that's what we'll do,\" Trudeau told reporters. In a phone call with Trump, Trudeau said the pair discussed trade and border security, with the prime minister pointing out that the number of migrants crossing the Canadian border was much smaller compared with the US-Mexico border. Trump's team declined to confirm the phone call. But Trump spokesman Steven Cheung added that world leaders had sought to \"develop stronger relationships\" with Trump \"because he represents global peace and stability\". Mexico's President Sheinbaum told reporters on Tuesday that neither threats nor tariffs would solve the \"migration phenomenon\" or drug consumption in the US. Reading from a letter that she said she would send to Trump, Sheinbaum also warned that Mexico would retaliate by imposing its own taxes on US imports, which would \"put common enterprises at risk\". She said Mexico had taken steps to tackle illegal migration into the US and that “caravans of migrants no longer reach the border”. The issue of drugs, she added, “is a problem of public health and consumption in your country’s society”. Sheinbaum, who took office last month, noted that US car manufacturers produce some of their parts in Mexico and Canada. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,” she said. Meanwhile, a spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, told the BBC that \"China-US economic and trade co-operation is mutually beneficial in nature\". He denied that China allows chemicals used in the manufacture of illegal drugs - including fentanyl - to be smuggled to the US. \"China has responded to US request for verifying clues on certain cases and taken action,\" Liu said. \"All these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality.\" President Joe Biden has left in place the tariffs on China that Trump introduced in his first term, and added a few more of his own. Currently, a majority of what the two countries sell to each other is subject to tariffs - 66.4% of US imports from China and 58.3% of Chinese imports from the US.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons in Ottawa, Trudeau told lawmakers that \"the idea of going to war with the United States isn’t what anyone wants\". He called on them to not \"panic\", and to work together. \"That is the work we will do seriously, methodically. But without freaking out,” he said. The leaders of Canadian provinces suggested that they would impose their own tariffs on the US. \"The things we sell to the United States are the things they really need,\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday. \"We sell them oil, we sell them electricity, we sell them critical minerals and metals.\" America's northern neighbour accounted for some $437bn (£347bn) of US imports in 2022, and was the largest market for US exports in the same year, according to US data. Canada sends about 75% of its total exports to the US. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said on Monday the proposed tariff would be \"devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the US\". “To compare us to Mexico is the most insulting thing I’ve ever heard,” said Ford. Ford was echoed by the premiers of Quebec, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, while a post on the X account of Alberta Premier Danielle Smith acknowledged that Trump had \"valid concerns related to illegal activities at our shared border\". The Canadian dollar, the Loonie, has plunged in value since Trump vowed to impose tariffs on Canadian imports come January. The Canadian dollar dipped below 71 US cents, the lowest level the Loonie has fallen to since May 2020, when Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods during his first stint as US president. The Mexican peso fell to its lowest value this year, around 4.8 cents."

      "full_content": "Imran Khan supporters pushed back by security forces\n\nEPA The city's roads have been blocked with shipping containers to stop the march reaching the centre\n\nSupporters of jailed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan have been pushed back by security forces after reaching the heart of the heavily-barricaded capital earlier on Tuesday. The convoy of opposition protesters has been marching towards Islamabad's D Chowk - or Democracy Square - since the weekend, demanding Khan's release, among other things. At least six people were killed - four paramilitary soldiers, and two protesters - as the march moved through the city, clashing with security forces at points. A number of protesters did make it as far as D Chowk however, and were seen scrambling over shipping containers placed to block their way.\n\nBut hours after protesters reached the square, security forces successfully cleared the area. As darkness fell, the lights were switched off - only police officers and paramilitary soldiers left behind. A police officer nearby said that some protesters had made it beyond the three-tier stack of shipping containers, but only a few hundred metres before they were pushed back. However, thousands of Khan supporters remain in the area - to keep warm in the biting cold, protesters have started burning paper and other materials inside rubbish bins. Many have even resorted to burning grass and bushes on the footpaths and greenbelts, where people are gathered. Muhammad Shahid, who came with his family all the way from Punjab province, says they’re here because of Imran Khan’s message: “He says we must fight for our rights.” He adds: “We’re here to stand up for our fundamental rights. Imran Khan has been illegally arrested, and we will fight to make our voices heard.”\n\nEPA\n\nKhan, who has been in prison for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated, has urged his supporters not to give up - encouraging people to continue towards D Chowk. \"My message to my team is to fight till the end, we will not back down,\" the former prime minister said on X. Even from behind bars, the former cricket star has proved a powerful player in Pakistan politics. During elections in February, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been banned from standing and was forced to run candidates as independents, emerged as the single largest bloc. However, they fell short of the majority and their rivals united to form a new government. As a result, protesters are also calling for the overturning of election results they say were rigged - a claim disputed by the government. It was Khan who called on his supporters to take to the streets at the weekend, issuing a \"final call\" and asking them to stay in the capital until their demands are met.\n\nThe government - which had already introduced a ban on public gatherings -responded by blocking Islamabad's streets with shipping containers, and bussing in police from across the country. Restrictions also appear to have been brought in on some internet services, while schools and colleges have been shut because of fears of violence. Pakistan's interior minister said the protesters had been offered an alternative venue for their protest but had refused. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who blamed the protesters for the deaths of four soldiers on Tuesday, dismissed the march as \"extremism\". \"These disruptive elements do not seek revolution but bloodshed,\" he said in a statement. Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party, told news agency Reuters at least two protesters had been killed - one shot, and one run over by a vehicle. At least 50 people have been injured."

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s team has signed an agreement with the Biden White House unlocking key transition briefings and activities after a lengthy delay that stemmed, in part, from the Trump team’s concerns over a mandatory ethics agreement.\n\nTrump transition officials could soon have access to agencies across the federal government, allowing the president-elect’s team to meet with outgoing officials and receive briefings on department activities.\n\nBut the team has yet to sign an agreement with the Department of Justice to begin processing the security clearances needed for staffers to access classified information during the transition period, White House officials said.\n\nThe Trump transition team made clear on Tuesday it’s doing things its own way, vowing to operate as a “self-sufficient organization.” That includes using its existing ethics plan and not using taxpayer funding or government buildings or technology provided by the General Services Administration for transition purposes. The team declined to sign a memorandum with GSA, due September 1, which would provide access to office space and secure communications, among other provisions.\n\n“The Transition already has existing security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight,” it said in its statement.\n\nThe Trump team blew past the initial deadlines to sign the White House agreement, which was due October 1, and the GSA plan in part because of concerns over the mandatory ethics pledge vowing to avoid conflicts of interest once sworn in to office.\n\nAs part of the agreement signed Tuesday, Trump’s transition team posted an ethics plan on the GSA website, as required by the Presidential Transition Act passed by Congress.\n\nWhite House agreement unlocks access to key agencies\n\nThe White House agreement serves as the gatekeeper for access to agencies and information and could lay the groundwork for Trump’s team to receive security clearances necessary to begin receiving classified information, although it was not immediately clear how that information sharing with the Biden administration would proceed.\n\n“This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power,” incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles said in a statement.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Saloni Sharma confirmed that Trump’s team signed the White House agreement, adding that the Biden administration and the GSA “repeatedly made the case” to Trump’s team to sign the pair of agreements starting in September.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, had pressed Trump and Wiles to sign the agreements during their November 13 Oval Office conversation, people familiar with that conversation said, and Trump and Wiles expressed openness to moving forward. Zients, a person familiar said, met once more with Wiles on November 19 to stress the importance of starting transition briefings for national security and other continuity purposes.\n\nThe lack of a memorandum of understanding may also have been taking a toll on prep for one of Trump’s biggest priorities — cracking down on immigration.\n\nOver recent weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement — an agency that will be key to Trump’s mass deportation plan — was trying to assess what additional resources and funds it would need to execute the president-elect’s pledge to detain and deport migrants at large scale, according to two sources familiar.\n\nBut in the absence of formal transition talks, ICE officials were basing assessments on the information and statements that were publicly available as they tried to outline the year ahead, the sources said.\n\nThe agency has historically been underfunded and will likely need more money from Congress. How much, however, remained unclear without formal information sharing, leaving a critical federal agency and congressional appropriators in the dark.\n\nThe Trump team, meanwhile, was also drawing up plans without a clear sense of ICE’s resources. A source close to transition planning told CNN they didn’t have a clear sense of ICE’s budget, which is crucial to planning.\n\nWith the White House agreement in place, members of the Biden administration can now begin to prepare their incoming counterparts for a handoff on January 20.\n\nThe signed agreement “will allow for certain, authorized members of the Trump transition team to have access to agency and White House employees, facilities, and information,” according to Sharma. White House officials said that federal agencies will receive guidance on facilitating secure information sharing with Trump’s team.\n\n“The fact is that on January 20 at 12 pm, President Trump and his team will be in seat. We have 2 options. Option one is no transition, potentially risking the security of the American people and our country. Option two is conduct a smooth transition with safeguards in the White House MOU to protect non-public information and prevent conflicts of interest,” Sharma said. “Option two is the responsible course and in the best interest of the American people.”\n\nOne watchdog group that had previously raised increasingly dire alarms about the threat to national security in the absence of the agreement expressed approval Tuesday.\n\n“This agreement unlocks direct access to information from federal agencies, which is vital for the incoming administration to be ready to govern on Day One and critical to the transition’s success,” Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said in a statement.\n\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised questions about the Trump team’s agreement.\n\n“This announcement fails to answer key questions about national security threats and FBI vetting of nominees, and increases concerns about corruption,” the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement.\n\n“There appear to be serious gaps between the Trump transition’s ethics agreement and the letter of the law. The reliance on private donors to fund the transition is nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money,” she added.\n\nTrump team doesn’t sign GSA agreement\n\nThe Biden White House did “not agree” with the decision to forego the GSA agreement.\n\n“While we do not agree with the Trump transition team’s decision to forgo signing the GSA MOU, we will follow the purpose of the Presidential Transition Act, which clearly states that ‘any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and wellbeing of the United States and its people,’” Sharma said.\n\nThere are certain safeguards in the signed White House memorandum, White House officials said, aimed at bolstering protections from conflicts of interest.\n\nFor instance, officials said, “The Trump transition team must provide the names and current employer of individuals who would have access to agencies, agency personnel, and government information,” and those who are receiving classified information must have “the security clearance necessary to have access to that information, the requisite need to know, and (have) signed the requisite non-disclosure agreements.”\n\nAs for the memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice, White House officials said that “progress has been made towards an agreement.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Office of Management and Budget and the GSA for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

      "full_content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nHuawei has unveiled a new flagship phone boasting entirely homegrown software that aims to give users an alternative to Google’s Android or Apple’s iOS, in another effort by the Chinese tech giant to defend against possible further sanctions by Washington.\n\nThe new Mate 70 smartphone, which starts at 5,499 yuan ($760), features the HarmonyOS Next operating system, which no longer supports Android-based apps. It’s touted as a “pure-blooded” technology developed solely by Huawei’s engineers.\n\n“This is our most powerful phone (in the Mate series),” Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei’s consumer business, said during the Tuesday launch event. “We have always been copied but never surpassed.”\n\nFrom next year, all of Huawei’s new phones and tablet devices would run on its own operating system, he added.\n\nThe Mate 70 is the successor to last year’s Mate 60 series, which shocked industry experts who couldn’t understand how the company could have the technology to make an advanced chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign semiconductor technology.\n\nThe Mate 70 represents a “critical step” in Huawei’s software evolution, Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys, told CNN.\n\nThe shift away from the Android ecosystem “will be essential for Huawei to maintain momentum in the premium segment, solidify consumer loyalty, and attract potential platform switchers,” he said.\n\nThat shift was made possible by the August 2023 launch of the Mate 60 Pro, which quickly became a symbol of the tech rivalry between the US and China. It also revived interest in Huawei’s high-end smartphone offerings.\n\nAccording to Canalys, Huawei’s share of the Chinese market for phones costing more than $600 has grown from 11% in the third quarter of 2022 to 33% in the same period this year, in a remarkable reversal of fortune for the company. Over the same period, Apple’s share of the same high-end market fell from 72% to 52%.\n\nHuawei, formerly the world’s second-largest maker of smartphones, had been fighting for survival since being hit by US export restrictions in 2019. The company’s woes later forced it to sell off its budget mobile brand, Honor, leaving it in bad shape.\n\nAndroid divorce\n\nThe first version of HarmonyOS, which supported Android-based applications, was launched in August 2019, months after Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from selling tech and software to the Chinese company without a license.\n\nThat ban prevented companies like Google from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS.\n\nBut over the years, Huawei has put its resources into developing what it called a fully homegrown platform to rival Western standards. Major Chinese tech companies have reportedly gotten on board, hiring developers to create compatible apps.\n\n“When we migrate … tens of thousands of other apps from the Android ecosystem to HarmonyOS, our HarmonyOS will be truly built and truly become the world’s third mobile operating system in addition to Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android,” Eric Xu, the then-rotating chairman of Huawei, said in April, according to a post on the company’s official WeChat account.\n\n“We will first build the HarmonyOS application ecosystem based on the Chinese market and then promote it country by country in the future and gradually promote it to the world.”\n\nOn Saturday, Xu said Huawei was aiming for 100,000 applications to be developed for its operating system over the next year. He said it was “crucial” to have a large number of apps and devices.\n\n“If no one uses it, no matter how advanced the operating system is, it will have no value,” he said, according to a Wechat post.\n\nMengmeng Zhang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said she expected the Mate 70 series to achieve more than 10 million shipments over its lifetime, adding: “It will take time for Huawei to expand the developer community and establish a competitive … ecosystem.”"

      "full_content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nFree agent left-hander Blake Snell and the Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to a five-year, $182 million contract, sources told ESPN on Tuesday night.\n\nThe deal, which is pending a physical, includes no opt-outs, some deferred money and a $52 million signing bonus, sources said.\n\nFor the Dodgers, Snell gives the World Series champions a frontline starter for their title defense next season after they survived October by depending heavily on their bullpen with just three healthy starters. For Snell, the pact marks a much quicker and satisfying conclusion to his second stint as a free agent.\n\nThe $182 million contract is the third largest for a left-handed pitcher in major league history based on total value, behind only David Price's with the Boston Red Sox in 2015 ($217 million) and Clayton Kershaw's with the Dodgers in 2014 ($215M).\n\nFor the Dodgers, it's another massive deal for a free agent. They have now handed out five contracts worth at least $100 million since the start of the 2023-24 offseason -- the same number as the rest of MLB combined.\n\nSnell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, opted out of the final season of his two-year, $62 million deal with the San Francisco Giants on Nov. 1 to become a free agent for the second straight offseason.\n\nHe joins the Giants' archrival in Southern California and a rotation that is, on paper, loaded for 2025. As it stands, the Dodgers boast Snell, Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow plus Dustin May, Tony Gonsolin, Bobby Miller and Kershaw -- should he re-sign with the club, as expected -- as options to round out the group. The Dodgers are also among the leading contenders to sign Japanese star right-hander Roki Sasaki, who is expected to be posted this winter.\n\nSnell was the National League Cy Young Award winner with the San Diego Padres in 2023 -- five years after winning the American League honor with the Tampa Bay Rays -- but his market never materialized to his liking. Concerns about inconsistent strike-throwing prompted his offers to fall short of the six-year, $162 million contract previously obtained by another power lefty in Carlos Rodon.\n\nHe instead joined the Giants in late March, missing most of spring training and struggling mightily at the start of the 2024 season. Six starts in, Snell held a 9.51 ERA and was headed to the injured list for a second time with a groin strain. When he returned, Snell performed like one of the game's best pitchers to finish at 5-3 with a 3.12 ERA and 145 strikeouts (and just 44 walks) in 104 innings over 20 starts, making his decision to opt out a no-brainer.\n\nIn 14 starts from early July to late September, the 31-year-old left-hander posted a 1.23 ERA with 114 strikeouts and 30 walks in 80⅓ innings. On Aug. 2, he threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds. In eight other instances, he completed at least six innings and allowed no more than two runs.\n\nHe was sidelined between April 19 and May 22 by a strained left adductor and between June 2 and July 9 by a strained left groin.\n\nRanking the top 50 MLB free agents How much the biggest stars get paid this winter? Kiley McDaniel breaks down this year's free agent class. Ranking top 50 free agents »\n\nSnell took the league by storm with the Rays in 2018, leading the majors with 21 wins and pacing the AL with a 1.89 ERA. He was solid over the ensuing four years, continually missing bats at an elite level, but his ERA jumped to 3.85 during that stretch.\n\nOverall, he is 76-58 with a 3.19 ERA in nine MLB seasons. The only pitcher in the majors over the past two seasons with at least 250 innings and a lower ERA than Snell is the Detroit Tigers' Tarik Skubal.\n\nSnell's $36.4 million average salary would rank as the fifth-highest among active deals next year behind Ohtani ($70 million), Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Zack Wheeler ($42 million), New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge ($40 million) and Texas Rangers right-hander Jacob deGrom ($37 million).\n\nThe Dodgers are currently +400 favorites to win the 2025 World Series at ESPN BET. There has not been a repeat World Series champion since the Yankees won three straight titles from 1998 to 2000. It's the longest drought without a repeat champion in MLB history.\n\nESPN's Alden Gonzalez, ESPN Research and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "full_content": "SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from the Season 33 finale of Dancing with the Stars, including who wins the mirrorball trophy.\n\nDancing with the Stars has officially crowned a Season 33 winner.\n\nNo one went home last week, so five couples were competing in Tuesday night’s lengthy three-hour finale filled with reflections on the last nine episodes and some fun performances from the pros. Before we get to the winner, let’s go through each couple’s final two performances and see how they fared.\n\nFirst up were the redemption dances, where the judges give each contestant an opportunity to revisit a style of dance they didn’t exactly nail, so they can showcase their improvements.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nOlympian Stephen Nedoroscik with partner Rylee Arnold. The Olympic gymnast is ready to nail his Quick Step from the moment he steps in rehearsals. Prancing around the dance floor to the tune of The Rembrandts’ “I’ll Be There For You,” clad in all pink outfits, he and Arnold were “running on top gear,” judge Bruno Tonioli, who chose the Quick Step for them as a redemption dance, said after seeing the performance. Score: 29 out of 30.\n\nThe Bachelor‘s Joey Graziadei with partner Jenna Johnson. The reality TV star’s redemption dance, assigned by Derek Hough, is a Cha Cha. Graziadei first tackled that dance in Week 1, and Hough wants to see the couple bring it to “the next level,” so Johnson is making things a lot harder this time around. High risk, high reward. And, it paid off. “That wasn’t a redemption dance. That was a punctuation mark, letting everyone know you are a contender [for the mirrorball trophy],” Hough told Graziadei after the dance. Score: 30 out of 30.\n\nSuper Bowl Champion Danny Amendola with partner Witney Carson. The football pro has had quite the journey on Dancing with the Stars, and he’s ready to show how far he’s come with this redemption dance. Hough assigns Amendola and Carson the Tango, a dance he previously tacked in Week 1. This time around, the choreography is much more difficult, and Amendola can’t focus too hard because needs to show some more emotion to get the scores he’s hoping for. “You were as muscular as always, but the lines, the shape, the placement of the steps, you really tried very, very hard,” Tonioli told him. “You really put the work in, and it shows.” Score: 27 out of 30.\n\nOlympic rugby player Ilona Maher with partner Alan Bersten. Tonioli wants to see Maher and Bersten tackle the Jive again. The Olympian knows it’s the perfect redemption dance for her to take on, but this time around, it’s the choreography is more complicated and the stakes are higher. Not that that mattered, because she killed it anyway. The improvements were so noticeable, and Carrie Ann Inaba gleefully declared: “Redemption is yours!” Score: 27 out of 30.\n\nChandler Kinney (Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin) with partner Brandon Armstrong. Kinney is hoping for perfect scores again this week, but, like Maher, she’ll have to get through the Jive first. With a few more weeks of competition under her belt, she’s ready to revisit the dance, assigned by Inaba. The judges were very impressed, with Tonioli telling Kinney she went “beyond redemption” to a “triumph.” It’s no wonder she got a perfect score. Score: 30 out of 30.\n\nAnd now, let’s take a look at those freestyles. One more dance before a winner is crowned!\n\nNedoroscik & Arnold. These two kick off the freestyle round, where all bets are off. Since there are no rules, Nedoroscik is determined to bring some of his gymnastics skills to the ballroom floor. Their bombastic final dance is set to “Viva La Vida” by Coldplay and, of course, it features a pommel horse. Tonioli says the performance was “athletic and artistic at the same time,” and it brought Inaba to tears. It seems only fitting it earned them their first perfect score. Score: 30 out of 30.\n\nGraziadei & Johnson. After earning a perfect score for their redemption Cha Cha, the former Bachelor needs to nail his freestyle for a chance at the mirrorball trophy. In this dance, Graziadei wants to showcase all that he’s learned over these 10 episodes, while also giving a nod to his tennis roots. Tennis rackets in hand, Graziadei and Johnson deliver an energetic freestyle that earns them plenty of praise from the judges, except for Inaba, who said it was a bit underwhelming. A stunned Hough and Tonioli disagreed. “How dare you, Carrie Ann? Joey, that was phenomenal,” Hough said. Score: 29 out of 30.\n\nAmendola & Carson. Amendola’s freestyle is an opportunity for him to let loose and show off his strength. Carson says she wants to portray that “anything is possible” with this dance, so they go with a Barbie theme. Hough calls Amendola a “moment maker,” calling the dance “one of the most entertaining things I’ve ever seen on this show.” Score: 29 out of 30.\n\nMaher & Bersten. After spending the season giving her all on the ballroom floor, Maher says she feels like she already won, even if she doesn’t bring home the trophy. Her freestyle to Chappell Roan’s “Femininomenon” really does light up the dance floor. “You’re shining brighter than ever!” Tonioli tells her. Bersten can’t help but pick Maher up and spin her around when they earn their very first perfect score. Score: 30 out of 30.\n\nKinney & Armstrong. The actress closes out the night with a freestyle that highlights Kinney’s commitment to trying new things. There are lifts and tricks galore, as Kinney and Armstrong are gunning for that mirrorball trophy. The final competitive dance of the season gets a stamp of approval from the judges. Not only does the dance slay, it also honors the history these two are making by being the first Black couple to make it to the Dancing with the Stars finale. Score: 30 out of 30.\n\nThe contestants certainly didn’t make this decision easy for the fans or the judges, but the couple taking home the mirrorball is…Joey and Jenna!"

It’s a minor change, but it’s nice to get firm confirmation that, despite ditching the Galaxy Note’s design language, the S25 Ultra won’t be ditching the iconic S Pen.\n\nOther images of the display show One UI 7’s new charging indicator as well as the curve radius of the display.\n\nThere are also some screenshots provided from One UI 7, showing off the new icons, camera app, and Quick Settings UI that we’ve seen a million times at this point, as well as confirming the S25 Ultra’s SM-S938B model number.\n\nSamsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 Ultra alongside the rest of the series in late January.\n\nMore on Galaxy S25:\n\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram"

      "full_content": "Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is part of a team of attorneys preparing a legal defense for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, bolstering his long-standing pro-Israel credentials as he reportedly weighs a run for New York City mayor next year.\n\nCuomo, a Democrat, is one of at least 17 attorneys assembled by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to defend Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as they face international charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The International Criminal Court in the Netherlands also brought similar charges against Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif.\n\nDershowitz listed Cuomo among the members of his “legal dream team” in a Wall Street Journal op-ed over the weekend. Dershowitz noted that the case will be tried in The Hague, but wrote that since neither the United States nor Israel recognizes the ICC’s jurisdiction, his team is motivated by “the court of public opinion.”\n\nCuomo confirmed his participation at a fundraising event for the National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education on Sunday in Manhattan.\n\n“This is a moment when true friends stand up, shoulder to shoulder, and fight for the state of Israel,” Cuomo said, as heard in a video of his remarks posted by The Forward.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor in 2021 after a decade in office. Prior to that, he served a term as New York’s attorney general.\n\nHis resignation came amid sexual harassment allegations and criticism of his administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes — dual scandals that would continue to hound him should he make a new run for public office. The former governor denies the allegations against him.\n\nWhile in office, Cuomo maintained a staunchly pro-Israel record, traveling to Jerusalem and meeting with Netanyahu while regularly speaking out against antisemitism.\n\nHe’s since remained in the public eye and is flirting with a return to electoral politics – all while continuing to bolster his pro-Israel credentials. He recently changed his voting address to an apartment in Manhattan ahead of next year’s mayoral election, when Mayor Eric Adams — who is currently under indictment — is up for re-election.\n\nAfter large-scale college protests erupted against Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, Cuomo and his allies — including Steven M. Cohen, his former top aide — launched a nonprofit called Never Again NOW!, which crafted an advertisement blasting protesters and accusing them of being sympathetic to Hamas.\n\nIt's been widely rumored Cuomo is considering a run for mayor. On Tuesday, Jewish Insider reported that Cuomo is preparing to launch a mayoral bid soon, citing anonymous sources familiar with the effort. Gothamist has not confirmed the details of the rumored launch.\n\nIn a statement, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said speculation over a Cuomo mayoral run is “premature.” Then he rattled off a list of the governor’s accomplishments.\n\n“New Yorkers know it was Gov. Cuomo who raised wages for hundreds of thousands of workers, codified Roe v. Wade into state law before the Supreme Court overturned it, put the strongest gun protections and paid family leave laws in the nation on the books and built projects previously declared impossible, such as the Moynihan train station, the new LaGuardia and JFK airports, the Second Avenue subway and the Kosciuszko Bridge, all while cutting taxes and reining in spending,” Azzopardi said.\n\nCuomo’s potential opponents in a Democratic mayoral primary wasted little time criticizing him.\n\nAssemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a Queens Democrat who is running for mayor, has been highly critical of Netanyahu and Israel’s actions in Gaza. In an interview with Gothamist, he blasted Cuomo for working with Dershowitz to defend the Israeli prime minister.\n\n“It's hard to imagine anything more sordid than our disgraced former governor teaming up with Donald Trump's impeachment lawyer to defend a war criminal, but apparently this is the company Andrew Cuomo wants to keep,” Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani has said that if he were mayor, he would have Netanyahu arrested if he came to New York City, compliant with the International Criminal Court charges.\n\nIn a statement responding to the Jewish Insider report, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — another mayoral candidate — accused Cuomo of eyeing public office to fulfill his “own personal revenge fantasies.”\n\n“The last thing New Yorkers need right now is another agent of corruption and chaos,” Lander said."

      "full_content": "A Russian spacecraft is finally open to the space station after its cargo delivery was delayed by an unusual smell.\n\nA robotic Progress spacecraft docked at the International Space Station as planned on Saturday (Nov. 23) after its launch on Nov. 21, but astronauts reported a strange stench coming from the vehicle that delayed unloading.\n\nNASA officials say the smell has receded and that the Progress unloading is going to plan as of Monday (Nov. 25). \"The crew reported the odor dissipated quickly and cargo transfer operations are proceeding on schedule,\" the agency wrote in an ISS blog post on Monday afternoon.\n\nRelated: 'Unexpected odor' on Russian spacecraft delays cargo delivery for ISS astronauts\n\nThe astronauts and ISS were never in any danger as a result of the stink, NASA has stressed. The agency added on Monday that the odor \"likely was outgassing from materials inside the cargo spacecraft,\" but did not offer more specifics.\n\nAs is standard practice, air scrubbers and contaminant sensors on the ISS \"monitored the station's atmosphere\" and flight controllers said the air quality of the ISS \"was at normal levels,\" NASA officials said in an initial post on the matter on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday (Nov. 24).\n\nCosmonauts working in the Poisk module, where the Progress spacecraft is docked, briefly wore extra protective equipment as a precaution, stated Anatoly Zak of RussianSpaceWeb.

For the past five years, there has been an ongoing air leak on the Russian side. NASA and its Russian counterpart, Roscosmos, continue to troubleshoot the leak, which poses no immediate risk to the ISS astronauts or station operations, NASA has stressed.\n\nThat said, the agencies — the chief partners in ISS operations — disagree as to the leak's cause and remedy. They also dispute how much of a risk the leak poses to the ISS over the long term.\n\nThe Progress will stay at the ISS for several months after its unloading. The crew will fill the spacecraft with trash and unneeded items before the Progress departs, to naturally burn up in Earth's atmosphere, in 2025.\n\nThere have been issues with Russian ships docked at the ISS not so long ago, but these were related to coolant. For example, a Soyuz crewed spacecraft leaked so much coolant in December 2022 that Roscosmos eventually sent up a replacement for its three-astronaut crew, doubling the astronauts' six-month stay to a year. In February 2023, a Progress cargo spacecraft sprang a coolant leak as well."

      "full_content": "It’s official: Vanderpump Rules is getting a refresh.\n\nBravo announced on Tuesday that its hit reality series will be returning for season 12 — but with an all-new cast. The news comes as the series, which was born as a spinoff of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, has been on hiatus following the aftermath of “Scandoval,” the scandal that catapulted the original cast into the zeitgeist and played out over the last two seasons to both eye-popping ratings and mixed audience results.\n\nSeason 12 will feature Lisa Vanderpump — Vanderpump Rules executive producer and the boss of SUR, the Los Angeles restaurant around which the show orbits — with a new group of “close-knit SUR-vers who are as complicatedly involved with one another as their iconic predecessors,” according to the announcement. “Under Lisa Vanderpump’s watchful eye, the West Hollywood mainstay SUR — and now TomTom — welcomes the next batch of servers, hosts and bartenders rife with plenty of drama, situationships and frenemies.”\n\nThe new season is set to begin production next year. The premiere date and names of the new cast will be announced at a later date.\n\nOriginal castmembers Lala Kent, Scheana Shay, Brock Davies and Tom Schwartz will all make appearances on the next season of Vanderpump Rules spinoff The Valley, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. A source close to the show leaves the door open for the entire cast — which also includes Ariana Madix, Tom Sandoval, James Kennedy and Katie Maloney — within The Valley, Vanderpump Rules and the larger Bravoverse.\n\nThere will also be a retrospective special highlighting the past 11 seasons that will “celebrate the past decade of heartbreaks, friendship rifts and scandals.”\n\n“What a thrill it is to build on the legacy of this series by doing it all over again,” said Alex Baskin, executive producer of Vanderpump Rules via 32 Flavors. “With profound appreciation for the original group and their iconic run, we can’t wait for the audience to see a dynamic new group of co-workers and friends make their way through life together.”\n\nVanderpump herself added, “The last 12 years of filming have been an extraordinary run full of laughter, tears and everything in between. I can’t thank enough those who have shared their lives. How I love you all. In the restaurant business, one shift always gives way to another. Cheers to the next generation of Vanderpump Rules.”\n\nVanderpump Rules has become one of Bravo’s biggest shows — the season 11 premiere had 3.2 million viewers over three days, and the season 10 reunion had 4.6 million after three days.\n\nThe 11th season of Vanderpump Rules, however, proved to be a divisive one following the aftermath of Scandoval; at the end of season nine, Sandoval’s secret affair with former castmember Rachel Leviss was exposed and the betrayal that became known as “Scandoval” catapulted Sandoval’s partner, Madix, into becoming a breakout star, led to Leviss’ exit from the series and turned Sandoval into a group-exiled villain. The 10th season explored the aftermath for the ensemble but, after a fractured finale and divided reunion, some fans were asking the network for a cast shake-up.\n\n“It was the hardest season that we’ve had to make,” Baskin told THR after that May 2024 reunion, which played the end of the finale in real time for the group, sparking an even deeper fissure. “The group was really divided. We went back into production not too long after the reunion, so you saw where the group really was. I think it’s a super powerful end of the reunion and there are a lot of unanswered questions that are playing out in real time.”\n\nThe show had been put on pause shortly before the reunion and went on hiatus after, with Baskin at the time weighing in on the uncertainty. “Everyone needs time to reset,” he said. “We cannot force group harmony, or even group interaction.” Still he remained hopeful that, whatever happens, the show would continue. “People have written the show’s final chapter many times, and the show has continued. … All things are possible. There’s still a strong core there. So I could totally see some version of the bulk of the cast returning and then some notable additions. I think there’s plenty of life. What form that takes, I don’t exactly know.”\n\nNews of the cast reboot follows Sandoval and Schwartz announcing the closure of their Los Angeles bar, Schwartz & Sandy’s, after two years of operation, citing negativity post-Scandoval, as well as slimmer margins in the aftermath of COVID. Their respective exes, Maloney and Madix, meanwhile, are operating their L.A. sandwich shop Something About Her, while Madix has pursued other roles outside of the Bravoverse, including in Broadway’s Chicago and hosting another reality hit, Love Island USA.\n\nFormer Pump castmember Stassi Schroeder is also joining Vanderpump on the next season of her Hulu series, Vanderpump Villa.\n\nVanderpump Rules is produced by 32 Flavors and Evolution Media. Baskin, Barry Poznick, Jenn Levy, Joe Kingsley, Vanderpump and Ken Todd executive produce."

      "full_content": "New details have emerged about how Liam Payne spent his final hours at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina — and the investigation has raised some serious questions.\n\nArgentine police released CCTV footage that appears to show Payne being carried by three men, believed to be hotel employees, back to his third-floor room minutes before his death. The former One Direction singer was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, according to his autopsy, and allegedly had caused multiple disturbances in the lobby in the days leading up to his death. However, Payne appears conscious in the video as he holds his head upright while carried. Shortly after he was taken back to his hotel room, the singer fell to his death.\n\nTMZ obtained the police report that claims Payne may have been trying to escape his room via the balcony when he fell. Some witness accounts allegedly support the theory. Payne had a bag strapped around his shoulder when his body was recovered, which he did not have in the lobby video from just before the incident. A hotel employee also discovered a brown duffel bag on the second-floor balcony directly below his room. There was a note that purportedly said \"for Liam\" with pills and a bottle of Jack Daniel's. One theory is that he dropped the bag down before attempting to escape from his balcony.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the surveillance video obtained by TMZ, Payne did not want to return to his room and struggled with hotel security, who used a master key to let him inside. The staff also removed a mirror outside his bedroom. Sources claim to the outlet that Payne did not like being alone in hotel rooms like he often was during his time with One Direction.\n\nWhile Payne was allegedly on a drug binge in mid-September, his bodyguard was concerned for his well-being and put him in a room while they were staying at a rental house in Florida. Payne allegedly escaped from the balcony using a garden hose, a source told TMZ.\n\nThe 911 call released shortly after Payne's Oct. 16 death showed that hotel employees were worried about Payne being in a room with a balcony, as they specifically mentioned it when calling for help. Moments later, Payne fell and died from \"multiple trauma\" injuries as \"the result of the fall,\" according to the autopsy. He was in a state of \"semi- or total unconsciousness.\" The prosecutor's office ruled out \"self-harm of any kind\" or that a third party was responsible for Payne's fall. He had traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system.\n\nThree people were arrested in connection with Payne's death. A former hotel employee and an alleged drug dealer were accused of selling him narcotics. Payne's friend Roger Nores, who was very close to the singer in recent months, was charged with abandonment as he saw Payne off the wagon an hour before the incident and left him alone. However, TMZ reported a judge ruled national prosecutors have no jurisdiction over the charge, and their appeal of the ruling was denied. Local prosecutors have yet to file charges.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCourt documents obtained by TMZ regarding the abandonment charge paint a troubling timeline leading up to Payne's death.\n\nThe night before the singer died, he ordered four bottles of whiskey. At 6:36 a.m. on Oct. 16, he ordered five more bottles. At 9:32 a.m., he allegedly asked Nores for \"6 grams,\" possibly referring to cocaine. The two had breakfast together and Nores left. At 2 p.m. Payne allegedly asked a hotel employee for another \"7 grams.\"\n\nNores returned around 3:45 p.m. Although a hotel employee claimed Payne was \"visibly drunk\" with dilated pupils, Nores left at 4:04 p.m. and told authorities he believed the singer was fine and did not seem under the influence of anything. Witnesses claim to have heard Payne breaking things in his room shortly after. Payne eventually made his way down to the lobby, where multiple guests claimed he appeared to act erratically. Payne was carried up by security before 5 p.m. Minutes later, he fell to his death.\n\nPayne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy is said to be heartbroken at the video released. \"He could have been saved, he could have been helped,\" her friend told the New York Post. \"It's devastating — and infuriating.\"\n\nPayne's ex-bandmate Zayn Malik, who attended the star's funeral last week, paid tribute to his friend at the first show of his \"Stairway to the Sky\" tour on Nov. 23. \"Liam Payne 1993-2024 Love You bro,\" with a red heart, flashed on the screen."

However activists have warned that millions of people with HIV will not be covered by the deals.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStegling said that such \"game-changers will really only get us to the right reduction in new infections when we make sure that everybody will have access to them\".\n\nUNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima did not attend the press conference.\n\nByanyima revealed last week that her husband, veteran Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye, was \"kidnapped\" in neighbouring Kenya earlier this month.\n\nUN rights chief Volker Turk has been among those calling for the Ugandan government to release Besigye, who appeared in a military court in the capital Kampala last week.\n\njdy-dl/giv"

It will land near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille within Mare Crisium, a more than 300-mile-wide basin located in the northeast quadrant of the lunar near side. The mission will carry NASA investigations and first-of-their-kind technology demonstrations to further our understanding of the Moon’s environment and help prepare for future human missions to the lunar surface, as part of the agency’s Moon to Mars exploration approach. This includes payloads testing lunar subsurface drilling, regolith sample collection, global navigation satellite system abilities, radiation tolerant computing, and lunar dust mitigation. The data captured also benefits humanity by providing insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces impact Earth.\n\nUnder the CLPS model, NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the Moon to enable industry growth and support long-term lunar exploration. As a primary customer for CLPS deliveries, NASA aims to be one of many customers on future flights.\n\nAs part of its Artemis campaign, NASA is working with multiple U.S. companies to deliver science and technology to the lunar surface. These companies are eligible to bid on task orders to deliver NASA payloads to the Moon. The task order includes payload integration and operations and launching from Earth and landing on the surface of the Moon. Existing CLPS contracts are indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts with a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028.\n\nFor more information about the agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative, see:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/clps\n\n-end-\n\nAlise Fisher\n\nHeadquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-2546\n\nalise.m.fisher@nasa.gov\n\nWynn Scott / Natalia Riusech\n\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n\n281-483-5111\n\nwynn.b.scott@nasa.gov / nataila.s.riusech@nasa.gov\n\nAntonia Jaramillo\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida\n\n321-867-2468\n\nantonia.jaramillobotero@nasa.gov"

      "full_content": "While Jupiter’s Great Red Spot has been a constant feature of the planet for centuries, University of California, Berkeley, astronomers have discovered equally large spots at the planet’s north and south poles that appear and disappear seemingly at random.\n\nThe Earth-size ovals, which are visible only at ultraviolet wavelengths, are embedded in layers of stratospheric haze that cap the planet’s poles. The dark ovals, when seen, are almost always located just below the bright auroral zones at each pole, which are akin to Earth’s northern and southern lights. The spots absorb more UV than the surrounding area, making them appear dark on images from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. In yearly images of the planet taken by Hubble between 2015 and 2022, a dark UV oval appears 75% of the time at the south pole, while dark ovals appear in only one of eight images taken of the north pole.\n\nThe dark UV ovals hint at unusual processes taking place in Jupiter’s strong magnetic field that propagate down to the poles and deep into the atmosphere, far deeper than the magnetic processes that produce the auroras on Earth.\n\nThe UC Berkeley researchers and their colleagues reported the phenomena today (Nov. 26) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nDark UV ovals were first detected by Hubble in the late 1990s at the north and south poles and subsequently at the north pole by the Cassini spacecraft that flew by Jupiter in 2000, but they drew little attention. When UC Berkeley undergraduate Troy Tsubota conducted a systematic study of recent images obtained by Hubble, however, he found they were a common feature at the south pole — he counted eight southern UV-dark ovals (SUDO) between 1994 and 2022. In all 25 of Hubble’s global maps that show Jupiter’s north pole, Tsubota and senior author Michael Wong, an associate research astronomer based at UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory, found only two northern UV-dark ovals (NUDO).\n\nA false-color ultraviolet image of the entire planet, showing the hood or cap of hydrocarbon haze that covers the south pole. The edge of the north polar hood is visible at the top. Troy Tsubota and Michael Wong, UC Berkeley\n\nMost of the Hubble images had been captured as part of the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) project directed by Amy Simon, a planetary scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and a co-author of the paper. Using Hubble, OPAL astronomers make yearly observations of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune to understand their atmospheric dynamics and evolution over time.\n\n“In the first two months, we realized these OPAL images were like a gold mine, in some sense, and I very quickly was able to construct this analysis pipeline and send all the images through to see what we get,” said Tsubota, who is in his senior year at UC Berkeley as a triple major in physics, mathematics and computer science. “That’s when we realized we could actually do some good science and real data analysis and start talking with collaborators about why these show up.”\n\nWong and Tsubota consulted two experts on planetary atmospheres — Tom Stallard at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the UK and Xi Zhang at UC Santa Cruz — to determine what could cause these areas of dense haze. Stallard theorized that the dark oval is likely stirred from above by a vortex created when the planet’s magnetic field lines experience friction in two very distant locations: in the ionosphere, where Stallard and other astronomers previously detected spinning motion using ground-based telescopes, and in the sheet of hot, ionized plasma around the planet shed by the volcanic moon Io.\n\nThe vortex spins fastest in the ionosphere, progressively weakening as it reaches each deeper layer. Like a tornado touching down on dusty ground, the deepest extent of the vortex stirs up the hazy atmosphere to create the dense spots Wong and Tsubota observed. It’s not clear if the mixing dredges up more haze from below or generates additional haze.\n\nBased on the observations, the team suspects that the ovals form over the course of about a month and dissipate in a couple of weeks.\n\n“The haze in the dark ovals is 50 times thicker than the typical concentration,” said Zhang, “which suggests it likely forms due to swirling vortex dynamics rather than chemical reactions triggered by high-energy particles from the upper atmosphere. Our observations showed that the timing and location of these energetic particles do not correlate with the appearance of the dark ovals.”\n\nThe findings are what the OPAL project was designed to discover: how atmospheric dynamics in the solar system’s giant planets differ from what we know on Earth.\n\n“Studying connections between different atmospheric layers is very important for all planets, whether it’s an exoplanet, Jupiter or Earth,” Wong said. “We see evidence for a process connecting everything in the entire Jupiter system, from the interior dynamo to the satellites and their plasma torii to the ionosphere to the stratospheric hazes. Finding these examples helps us to understand the planet as a whole.”\n\nThe work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION"
