      "full_content": "US to start immediately on fresh push for Gaza ceasefire\n\nShutterstock\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said the US will make another push with regional powers for a ceasefire in Gaza, involving the release of hostages and the removal of Hamas from power. His remarks on X come just hours after a ceasefire came into force in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, ending nearly 14 months of conflict. Hamas said it hoped for a similar deal in Gaza but continues to reject Israel's demands, which it perceives as surrender. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \"Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power,\" Biden said on X. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden had agreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right before the announcement of the Lebanon ceasefire to try again for a Gaza agreement, which negotiators have sought unsuccessfully for months. The US and its Arab allies used to say that a ceasefire in Gaza would end the conflict with Hezbollah. Now they are hoping for the reverse. The argument goes that the truce in Lebanon shows compromises are possible and that Hamas may now feel more isolated, putting pressure on it to agree to concessions. However, the goals of the Israeli government in Lebanon were always more limited than those in Gaza, where it has failed to agree a post-war plan. Qatar recently suspended its efforts to help mediate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Palestinian territory until both sides shifted their positions. Hamas insists on ending the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, while Israel remains determined to destroy Hamas. Netanyahu's political survival is also bound up with Gaza. His far-right coalition partners aspire to rebuild Jewish settlements there and have threatened to collapse the government if Israel makes a “reckless” agreement to stop the fighting. Netanyahu also worries that a ceasefire could open the way to a commission of inquiry into Israel’s failure to prevent the 7 October attacks, which would be very damaging for him.\n\nEPA Many Israelis feel their government has not done enough to free the hostages\n\nHamas reacted positively to the Lebanon ceasefire, and said it was ready to consider a truce in Gaza. “We appreciate the steadfastness of the brotherly Lebanese people, and their constant solidarity with the Palestinian people,” Hamas leader Basem Naim told the BBC. \"We express our commitment to cooperate with any efforts to stop the fire in Gaza, and we are concerned with stopping the aggression against our people.\" The organisation has faced significant challenges, including an inability to convene its leadership since the killing of Yahya Sinwar by Israel. Its leaders are now scattered across Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and disconnected from those managing the hostages held in Gaza. These hostages appear to be Hamas’s remaining leverage, as the group’s capacity to fight Israel has been very limited, and its popularity has significantly declined in Gaza. Amos Hochstein, the US envoy who negotiated the ceasefire in Lebanon, told BBC Newshour he was hopeful the deal could pave the way to a ceasefire in Gaza and even for the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. \"I know I sound crazy, but then again people thought I sounded crazy when I said I thought I could get a deal in Lebanon,\" he said. \"I read many articles [about] how I was in fantasy-land. \"Will it happen? I don't know, but we have an opportunity and I think that's why this deal is so important. \"It's not just about Lebanon. It's a key that unlocks potentially an even broader door.\" Despite insisting on three conditions - an Israeli withdrawal, a permanent ceasefire and the reconstruction of Gaza - Hamas has indicated to mediators on many occasions its willingness to make substantial concessions. For now, Hamas remains unwilling to agree to terms it perceives as surrender, but it has little room for manoeuvre in the negotiations, as the gap between the two sides has become deeper and the sound of the guns will remain louder. Meanwhile, on Gaza's streets, the ceasefire has raised some concerns. \"We were overjoyed by the cessation of the war in Lebanon, and we also hope for the same here in the Gaza Strip,\" one man in Khan Younis told Gaza Today. \"However, at the same time, we have concerns that the occupation army might once again intensify its raids in Gaza and that its military forces might return from Lebanon to Gaza.\" “We don’t want anyone to experience what we’ve gone through here in Gaza,\" another man said. \"We don’t want to see children killed, women trapped under rubble, or the recurring scenes of bloodshed in Lebanon that we have witnessed here. \"On the other hand, I believe the Israeli army will focus its raids on Gaza.\""

      "full_content": "Bomb threats made against Trump cabinet nominees\n\nGetty Images Lori Chavez-Deremer, Lee Zeldin and Elise Stefanik were among those threatened\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees and picks for his White House team have been targeted by bomb threats. The FBI said it was aware of \"numerous bomb threats\" as well as \"swatting incidents\", in which hoax calls are made to attract a police response to the target's home. Threats were made against at least nine people chosen by Trump to lead the Departments of Defence, Housing, Agriculture and Labor, as well as his pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, among others. Police are investigating the incidents, which happened on Tuesday night and Wednesday.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said the Trump appointees “were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them”. She said \"law enforcement acted quickly to ensure\" the nominees' safety. \"With President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us,” she said. Neither Leavitt nor the FBI identified any of the targets by name. New York Republican Elise Stefanik, who Trump has named to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, was the first to say her family home had been targeted by a bomb threat. Her office said the congresswoman was informed of the threat while she was driving with her husband and three-year-old son from Washington DC to New York for Thanksgiving. Defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth later confirmed that he was also targeted. On X, he said that a police officer had shown up at his home on Wednesday morning, as his seven children were sleeping inside to notify him they had received \"a credible pipe bomb threat\". \"I will not be bullied or intimidated. Never,\" he wrote. \"President Trump has called on me to serve - and that is what I intend to do.” 'I had 60 seconds to protect my family': Swatting targets US politicians Trump, who survived two assassination attempts during his campaign, was not among those who received the hoax calls, law enforcement sources told US media. He has received genuine threats recently, according to officials in Arizona who arrested a man earlier this week for posting videos on a \"near-daily basis\" in which he threatened to kill Trump and his family. None of those targeted this week were protected by the US Secret Service, according to media reports."

      "full_content": "Don’t Miss All the Twists and Turns! For exclusive news and updates, subscribe to our Dancing With the Stars Newsletter:\n\nThe Len Goodman Mirrorball trophy for Dancing With the Stars Season 33 was anyone’s to win given the level of artistry, dedication, and skill that all five finalists exhibited throughout the season and going into last night’s finale. The winning couple was Bachelor star Joey Graziadei and Jenna Johnson, who turned in consistently great performances over the last 13 weeks.\n\nThe show’s judges – Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli – were raising “10” paddles freely throughout the night. However, Inaba gave Graziadei and Johnson a “9” for their tennis-themed freestyle, which elicited some strong reactions from the show’s studio audience.\n\n“I was a little defeated [by that],” Johnson told TV Insider on the post-show press line right after the finale. “I thought Joey did absolutely exquisite in it. But I was actually brought back to my season with Adam Rippon [in 2018]. I think we got [three] 8’s and I was so defeated then, but we ended up winning.”\n\nGraziadei already felt like a winner when he received a shoutout in a pre-taped video package during the show from his fiancé Kelsey Anderson. “She said I have got a leg up on her for [our wedding] dance,” the Mirrorball champion said with a smile.\n\nJohnson likewise feels like a champion in the relationship department. She credited her husband Val Chmerkovskiy, who was eliminated earlier in the season with Phaedra Parks, for helping her win her second trophy. “He’s been my No. 1 supporter throughout this,” she raved. “He’s been Mommy and Daddy [to our son Rome] for us right now while I’ve been getting ready for this.”\n\n“I don’t even know how I felt [when we won],” Graziadei said. “I honestly blacked out. I remember Jenna screaming really loud. I remember hugging her and Val coming in. This [trophy] is heavier than I thought it would be!”\n\nWhat’s next for the winning couple? They’re both set to take part in some of the DWTS Tour. (Click here to see when the show might be coming to a city or town close to you.)\n\nGraziadei shared that he and Kelsey have settled into a new place in Los Angeles where they’ll be situated for the foreseeable future. The former Bachelor star could have the option of having a private wedding or, given his increased popularity, the possibility of a televised special – if that were to fit in with ABC’s programming needs. The risk of that, however, is that the day becomes more public than private.\n\n“We’re both in the process of starting to figure it out and we both said what we want it to be for us,” he said. “So, however you want to take that. We’ll figure out what it is. But it’s going to be just for us and we’re going to make sure it’s something special that we can look back on.”\n\nChandler Kinney and Brandon Armstrong came in third place. Like Graziadei and Johnson, they performed well and scored highly very consistently throughout the season. “I’m just happy to be here,” Armstrong told TV Insider before he, Kinney, and the other couples headed to the airport to fly to New York City for TV appearances. “I really am. It’s a win for me to be here,” he added.\n\n“It was more important for our freestyle to be brilliant than our placing,” Armstrong philosophized. “Joey is so amazing. We’re all very proud of him and Jenna.”\n\nKinney is not only happy to have competed alongside Olympians (runner-up Ilona Maher, fourth place finisher Stephen Nedoroscik) but also to have taken Armstrong to the finals for the first time in his career. “I’m very proud of that,” she said.\n\nThe show opened up Kinney to a whole new audience but she feels that audiences could have gotten to know her even better through some of the pre-dance video packages had they been edited a bit differently. “I wish they had shown my struggle more,” she admitted with a slight laugh, “because I did struggle! I cried in many rehearsals because it was really hard and I never wanted it to look easy. Beyond that, I wouldn’t change anything I did because I was true to myself and grateful.”\n\nFootball star Danny Amendola and Witney Carson came in fifth place but had some of the most memorable dances this season including their Wolverine/Deadpool Jazz performance to “Bye, Bye, Bye” during Disney Night. Speaking of the big screen, does Carson have any aspirations for a career in scripted TV or films? “Carrie Ann just asked me if I’ve ever acted,” Carson shared. “I’ve thought about it, but I think dancing is where I’m at right now.”\n\n“She can really sing, too,” playfully interjected Amendola, prompting Carson to respond with a laugh, “No, I can’t!”\n\nAfter a beat, she added, “Heck, if they call me, I’ll do an audition…sure, why not?” Amendola offered in support, “I think you’d be awesome.”\n\nThe pressure of learning a new dance or even two each week is now over, but Nedoroscik says he’s facing a new challenge now that he’s taken on the role of hosting the upcoming Dancing With the Stars tour. “I’m thinking, ‘Oh, man, I have to host this tour!’” the pommel horse champion said with an enthusiastic smile."

      "full_content": "New York CNN —\n\nMicrosoft is set to go under the microscope of the nation’s top antitrust watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission, which is launching a sweeping investigation into the tech giant’s practices.\n\nThe FTC, in a letter sent to Microsoft, demanded that it hand over information to assist in the agency’s investigation, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThe FTC and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nThe probe was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nMicrosoft’s business is wide-ranging. It has quickly become a leading player in the emerging artificial intelligence space, thanks to an investment in OpenAI and its own AI system, Copilot, which built on the company’s existing cloud computing, enterprise software, gaming and device businesses.\n\nAnd the company has faced antitrust concerns before. European officials earlier this year considered a formal investigation of Microsoft’s OpenAI partnership, part of a wider effort to assess competition in the AI field, although the probe never materialized.\n\nMicrosoft also battled FTC resistance to its $69 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, which closed in October 2023. The agency had argued the merger would give Microsoft a monopoly in video game publishing, which the company denied.\n\nA new chapter for the FTC\n\nThe investigation comes just months before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump hasn’t yet announced whom he plans to nominate to lead the FTC, but he is all but certain to replace the agency’s current chair, Lina Khan.\n\nThe new administration could also toss out any current FTC investigations.\n\nTrump’s reelection has raised questions about how his administration will handle ongoing antitrust cases against tech giants, including Apple and Amazon. Google also awaits a decision on whether a federal judge will accept the US government’s recommendation that it should be forced to sell off Chrome after its search business was ruled a monopoly.\n\nThe FTC has blocked dozens of mergers and acquisitions under the direction of Khan in conjunction with the Justice Department. But in addition to the Activision Blizzard acquisition, the agency has suffered several defeats in regulating big tech.\n\nTwo years ago, it abandoned a case seeking to block Meta from purchasing virtual reality start-up Within Unlimited. It also hasn’t successfully proved that Meta illegally cut competition by purchasing Instagram and WhatsApp, a case it launched four years ago.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments."

      "full_content": "Tens of millions will travel across the United States for the Thanksgiving holiday, many crisscrossing the country. As far as the weather is concerned, this looks to be a relatively tranquil week — with some exceptions for snow and rain. Much of the country will be beneath high pressure and sinking air, which will bring dry, cool weather. The exception will be in parts of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where a developing storm system is set to deliver coastal rains and inland snow. The system will march up the Appalachian Mountains on Thursday into Friday. Lake-effect snow will plaster areas including Upstate New York in its wake.\n\nWhen it comes to travel, storms are always a problem this time of year, so it’s important to do early research into dealing with delayed and canceled flights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor air travel, the best way to stay on top of your schedule is by downloading your airline’s mobile app and signing up to get notifications by phone, text, email or push alert. Those apps can alert you to gate changes and cancellations in real time, and they offer you an easy way to rebook flights instead of getting in line to see a customer service agent at the airport.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration noted Wednesday that low clouds and winds may affect flights in Boston, Tampa, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Seattle, with snow-related delays possible in Minneapolis and Denver.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of weather to watch for the rest of the week.\n\nWednesday\n\nA main area of weather to be concerned with Wednesday afternoon is in Colorado. Monarch Pass in the Rocky Mountains picked up 26 inches. Denver and Colorado Springs saw only between 2 and 4 inches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat snow was winding down, but the same system was sliding east, bringing rain to portions of Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. Interstate 70 could be mess.\n\nThe rain was navigating a baroclinic zone, or zone of temperature clash between frigid air over the Great Lakes and milder air in the Southeast. A storm system will form along that zone by Wednesday evening, causing rain to increase in coverage and intensity across much of the Midwest. It may end as a bit of snow in Indianapolis overnight.\n\nTravel ahead of the holiday has been smooth, with low numbers of flight cancellations and delays over the past week, said Kathleen Bangs, spokeswoman for the flight-tracking service FlightAware.\n\n“Everything is extraordinarily good,” she said Wednesday morning. By early Wednesday afternoon, fewer than 30 U.S. flights scheduled for that day had been canceled and close to 1,650 had been delayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport, where the FAA instituted a ground delay Tuesday because of staffing shortages, has seen about twice the number of delays compared with the same time a year ago, Bangs said.\n\nShe said people should keep an eye on Denver for storm impacts Wednesday, but worse weather appeared to be holding off until Thursday and Friday.\n\n“That’s what you want, because that’s when most people aren’t traveling,” she said.\n\nSkip to end of carousel How to avoid the worst parts of holiday travel illustration for BTW-annoyingtravel (Washington Post illustration; iStock) Long airport lines, highway gridlock and expensive hotels can feel inevitable. But we’ve got tips to relieve your travel pains. End of carousel\n\nThursday\n\nThe storm system will move up the Appalachians. Areas including Cleveland; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Buffalo will all see some snow, but probably only a slushy inch or two of accumulation.\n\nMuch of central and western New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and western Maine will see snow. Accumulations of a few inches are likely, but 4 to 6 inches could fall in the higher terrain, and 6 inches or more in the mountains. There’s a chance that snowfall totals may wind up higher in southern Vermont and New Hampshire if cold air remains entrenched in the region, which is why winter storm watches have been issued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the system’s east side, a slug of heavy rain will work up the Interstate 95 corridor. It will begin around daybreak in Virginia, soaking Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia around sunrise, New York City during the late morning and Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, by lunchtime. Travel along Interstates 95 and 84 will probably be a bit slow.\n\nA cold front dragged east by the low-pressure system could touch off a couple of isolated thunderstorms in the Southeast, with a marginal risk of becoming severe. There’s a very low-end risk of tornadoes.\n\nOtherwise, the majority of the country will be quiet.\n\nBangs, a former airline pilot, said she could foresee delays on the East Coast because of the upcoming rainy weather, but she didn’t expect many cancellations.\n\n“The weather looks like it’s going to be fairly decent across most of the country, so that’s good,” she said.\n\nFriday and beyond\n\nRemarkably, most of the Lower 48 will see mostly calmer weather, though it will be quite cold in the East. The exception to that calm will be around the Great Lakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it’s a bit early to pinpoint specifics, weather models indicate a bowling ball of cold air and low pressure will park overhead. That will steer cold air down the length of the lakes. Water temperatures near Buffalo on Lake Erie are around 51 degrees, but air temperatures will be in the lower to mid-30s.\n\nThat’s a classic recipe for lake-effect snow. The Tug Hill Plateau and regions south of Buffalo could pick up several feet by Monday in narrow swaths, although it’s not clear yet where the bands will become established.\n\nModerate to heavy lake-effect snows are in the snow belts associated with Lakes Huron, Superior and Michigan, although the greater totals will occur in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan or southern Canada."

      "full_content": "People with HIV will be able to receive kidney or liver transplants from donors who also have HIV, federal health officials announced Tuesday. Until now, such transplants were only allowed as part of research studies. Otherwise, people with HIV could not donate their kidneys or livers. The landmark move, which takes effect Wednesday, is expected to shorten wait times for organs for all patients and reduce hurdles to lifesaving care for those with HIV.\n\nIt’s also a testament to medical progress in treating HIV and bolsters efforts to lessen stigma around the disease, experts say. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration eased the blood-donation ban on gay and bisexual men — a remnant of the AIDS crisis. And last spring, a top U.S. pediatricians’ organization said mothers with HIV can breastfeed if they are taking certain medication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s gone from a death sentence to a completely manageable disease,” said Christine Durand, a professor of medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Durand was the lead author of a study published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine that affirmed the safety of organ transplants between donors and recipients with HIV.\n\n“This study really shows without a doubt that there’s no differences between receiving a kidney from a donor with HIV versus without HIV,” Durand said. “In addition to reducing stigma, this can help reduce inequities for people with HIV.”\n\nDurand’s team followed 198 organ recipients for up to four years. Ninety-nine of them received a kidney from a donor with HIV, and another 99 received a kidney from a donor without HIV. The researchers looked for a range of safety outcomes, including death or kidney failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth groups had equivalent success rates, Durand said. “Patient survival was very high in both groups, kidney survival was excellent. … In some ways, it was a boring study, but it really emphasized the safety of this: There were no significant differences.”\n\nSouth African scientists first provided evidence in 2010 that suggested organs could be safely transplanted from donors with HIV to recipients with HIV. After intense lobbying, the U.S. government in 2013 lifted a 25-year ban on the practice with the passage of the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act. This allowed such transplants to occur within research studies — the first one occurred in 2016 at Johns Hopkins, Durand said.\n\nBut the protocols were stringent, limiting many transplant centers from offering the treatment, she said. Removing the research restrictions should, hopefully, mean that more institutions will begin offering the treatment to patients with HIV, she said. The new rule should also increase access for all patients who need kidney and liver transplants, regardless of HIV status, because there will be more organs available.\n\n“On the East Coast, where the demand is high, the wait-list can be two to five years,” Durand said. For people with HIV, the wait time is often longer. “This should reduce wait times overall.”"

      "full_content": "PIEDMONT, Calif. — Three people were killed and one seriously injured early Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck crashed and caught fire in northern California, officials said.\n\nPiedmont Police Chief Jeremy Bowers said speed was likely a factor in the single-vehicle collision, but he added that authorities would continue to investigate the circumstances of the tragedy.\n\nThe Cybertruck’s occupants had been driving back from a “function” around 3:10 a.m. Wednesday, but Bowers would not give additional details. Someone who also had been at the function, but was driving in a separate car, was able to pull the surviving victim out of the Cybertruck.\n\nThe chief would not release any identifying details of the victims, citing family privacy.\n\nAlthough the police officers who responded were unable to douse the flames with their fire extinguishers, the fire department put the blaze out quickly.\n\nPiedmont Fire Chief Dave Brannigan said the speed in extinguishing the flames meant it was unlikely that the Cybertruck’s large lithium-ion battery had caught fire. He called the incident “more along the lines of a typical car fire.”\n\nBowers, addressing a question about recent Cybertruck recalls, said “there’s no indication that there were mechanical effects that were the primary cause for the collision.”\n\nThe Cybertruck, which has been on sale for about a year, has been recalled six times for safety problems, most recently on Nov. 5 because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power.\n\nOther recalls covered rearview camera images that don’t activate immediately after shifting into reverse, trim pieces that can fall off, windshield wipers that can fail, and an incorrect font size on instrument panel warning lights. In April, the futuristic trucks were recalled to fix gas pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim.\n\nThe city of Piedmont is about 2.5 miles northeast of Oakland."

      "full_content": "Jugs of raw milk fill a refrigerator at Raw Farm dairy in Fresno in June. (Tomas Ovalle / For The Times)\n\nLess than a week after California health officers confirmed a finding of bird flu virus in store-bought raw milk, state agriculture officials descended on Mark McAfee's Raw Farm dairy \"like never before\" Wednesday and began collecting samples from the farm's two herds, creamery, bulk milk tanks and trucks, according to the owner.\n\nThe visit follows a recall of Raw Farm products, and also comes amid a growing series of H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in state dairy farms. Raw Farm maintains 1,800 head of cattle spread over two herds — one in Fresno, the other outside of Hanford, according to McAfee. The company also owns a Fowler-based creamery.\n\n\"I think they are on full attack mode,\" he said, describing the search as thorough. In addition to milk, Raw Farm produces cheese and kefir.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs California Department of Food and Agriculture officials collected samples and conducted tests at the dairy Wednesday, some health experts raised questions and concerns about the recent positive test results.\n\nRead more: Despite warnings from bird flu experts, it's business as usual in California dairy country\n\nLast week, public health officials in Santa Clara County detected bird flu virus in a store-bought sample of McAfee's raw milk. Two days later, the California Department of Public Health confirmed the finding.\n\nBut when state agriculture officials tested cows at McAfee's dairy farm on Monday, they failed to detect the virus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe fact that none of the animals are known to be infected with the virus has puzzled and concerned public health experts. Generally, once the virus appears on a farm, it spreads and does not just disappear.\n\n\"The fact that all the supplemental testing is negative really bothers me,\" said John Korslund, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian epidemiologist, in an email.\n\nOfficials from the CDFA could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but infectious disease experts told The Times that officials probably were reviewing testing procedures, as well as the actual origin of the sampled milk.\n\nAccording to testing records, the initial sample of store-bought raw milk carried high levels of the virus, and was found to have a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold — or Ct — of roughly 25.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"A herd should not be immediately negative after a reading of 25 if it is truly milk from the same herd, IMO,\" Korslund wrote in an email.\n\nRichard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, and a researcher in the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., agreed.\n\n\"OK, that’s not a weak positive … and definitely not on the borderline where some tests would be positive and others negative,\" he said after reviewing the test records.\n\nWebby, Korslund and other experts say the test that was used only looks for the H5 part of the H5N1 virus, and it can't determine if the virus is inactive or alive. A second test — one called a virus isolation test — needs to be done to confirm the sample is H5N1 and that it is active.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead more: Warning issued for contaminated raw milk sold in L.A. County stores\n\nState and federal health officials say the H5N1 bird flu virus poses a low risk to the public. However, they have urged people not to drink raw, unpasteurized milk. There has been no reported outbreak in consumers associated with the bird flu in contaminated raw milk.\n\nThe milk was bottled on Nov. 9. Raw Farm has recalled all products associated with the positive sample. McAfee estimates the recall involved roughly 2,000 gallons of half- and quarter-gallon \"cream top\" whole milk products.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, 461 herds have been infected in California — including herds in Fresno and Kings County, where McAfee's herds are located.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEarly in the H5N1 dairy outbreak, federal health officials tested pasteurized milk samples and found virus in 20% of the samples collected from retail shelves. However, when further testing was conducted — virus isolation — they were able to show it was inactivated virus that had been denatured by heat.\n\nSo, why then would a raw milk sample test high for virus and a dairy herd not test positive?\n\nKorslund acknowledged that testing and sampling can sometimes be compromised, but he was not inclined to doubt the tests in this instance. He said the Ct value — and the lack of subsequent positive tests — suggests a \"product integrity issue rather than a herd infection.\"\n\n\"What if somewhere in the bottling process, pasteurized shelf milk was spiked into the raw milk to meet inadequate supply demands? In such a scenario, we don't have a testing issue; rather it's a product integrity issue that normally would be undetectable,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is why virus isolation testing is critical, Korslund said. It would help determine whether the virus in the sample collected was alive or not.\n\nA spokesman for the state's health department said testing on the sample was complete. He did not say whether viral isolation had been completed, but noted the positive result has been confirmed by state and now federal laboratories.\n\nMcAfee said he does not think the virus is present in his herd. The tests that the state's agriculture department have been regularly conducting — twice a week — on his bulk milk have been negative. In addition, he noted, a test taken on Monday also showed no virus.\n\nHe said he also monitors each cow at his farms with a high-tech device — made by the Austrian company smaXtec — that sits in a cow's udder and sends real-time information about the animal's body temperature, milk acidity, etc.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe said there are no indications that virus is moving through his herd based on those data.\n\nHe also said all his operations — including his trucks, his bulk tanks and bottling plant — are closed to outside farms and milk; they are used only by Raw Farm.\n\nHe said he's worried state officials are determined \"to find something.\"\n\n\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

      "full_content": "After 20 years, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry is ready to return to the Wisteria Lane of another era.\n\nFollowing the hit ABC series’ milestone anniversary last month, the 2x Emmy-nominated EP and showrunner recently shared his vision for a reboot of Desperate Housewives, which ran for eight seasons from 2004 to 2012.\n\n“I would probably want to do the idea maybe in an earlier decade. Because the character I miss writing the most is actually Wisteria Lane,” he told People. “That was the most fun playground anyone in the history of television has ever had, because we owned the whole street.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nCherry continued, “I know that street like the back of my hand. When someone shoots a commercial on that street, I know it instantly, because I know all those houses, I know the geography. It was such a fun place to write for. And there’s times when I go, ‘You know what? I wonder if I could write Wisteria Lane in like, 1966.'”\n\nCherry noted that “about 70,000 people” have asked him about a reboot. “The truth of the matter is that I have a couple of ideas to do it,” he said.\n\nDesperate Housewives stars Dana Delany, Marcia Cross, Teri Hatcher, Brendan Strong, series creator Marc Cherry, stars Eva Longoria Parker, Nicollette Sheridan and Felicity Huffman celebrate the series’ 100th episode.

I learned so much,” added Cherry, explaining that the key to a potential reboot would be determining if “there is still stuff that needs to be said.”\n\n“If you do a reboot, you have to have a really good artistic reason to do it. And at some point, I’ll sit down with someone and go, ‘Okay, let’s talk about if there’s a good enough “why” to do it,'” said Cherry.\n\nDesperate Housewives stars Teri Hatcher, Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross and Nicollette Sheridan as the women of Wisteria Lane, who begin uncovering dark secrets after their neighbor Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) kills herself.\n\nCherry has since gone onto create the shows Devious Maids and Why Women Kill."

      "full_content": "THANKSGIVING UPDATE: It turns out Moana, singing witches and gladiators can co-exist together and won’t devour each other. All boats rose in the first day of the Thanksgiving stretch as Disney’s opening day of Moana 2, Universal’s Wicked and Paramount’s Gladiator II led all titles to a $92.2M Wednesday, which was easily the second highest grossing moviegoing day of 2024 after Friday, July 26, when Disney/Marvel Studios’ Deadpool & Wolverine drove all titles to a $118.3M gross. Read further down, tomorrow, Black Friday, is bound to push yesterday’s harvest to third best daily tally of the year.\n\nMoana 2 came in with $57.5M yesterday, including $13.8M Tuesday previews, which made it the best day ever for a Walt Disney Animation title, and the third best opening for an animated movie after Incredibles 2 ($71.2M) and Inside Out 2 ($63.5M). Disney continues to see a 5-day $175M+ five-day Thanksgiving record, not only for an opening title, but theatrical release during the holiday period. 3-day is at $116M. The swing factor is tomorrow, Black Friday in regards to how massive, or how short Moana 2 goes. No one is expecting her to fall into the ocean — rivals see this Disney animated sequel sailing past $200M+ by Sunday. Moana 2 gets an A- CinemaScore, which is the same as Frozen 2. Disney’s most watched movie on Disney+, the original Moana, got an A.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWicked saw its highest weekday gross yesterday so far, and the fourth highest day in its run with a fantastic $20.4M. Doesn’t seem like anyone minds the 2 hour and 40 minute running time, and there is a vibrant confidence from sources about the pic’s legs. This puts the Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo movie toward a second weekend of $63.3M (-44%) and a 5-day of $97.1M. Don’t be surprised if it hits $100M. Running total by Sunday makes it the highest grossing movie based on a Broadway show at $242M. How high does this Jon M. Chu directed musical feature go? The highest grossing musicals of all-time at the domestic box office belong to Warner Bros’ Barbie ($636.2M), The Lion King ($543.6M), and Disney’s live-action take of Beauty and the Beast ($504.4M).\n\nGladiator II ain’t no chump with a $6.6M Wednesday, second weekend of $28M, -49%, and a 5-day of $40M for a running total by Sunday $107.2M.\n\n(L-R) Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey in ‘Queer’ A24\n\nAlso opening in select NYC and LA theaters was Luca Guadagnino’s Daniel Craig movie, Queer, taking in $74K yesterday at seven locations for what’s looking like an estimated $268K 3-day and $390K 5-day. The movie, which is based on William S. Burroughs’ novel is set in 1950s Mexico, and follows an American ex-pat who leads a solitary life amidst a small American community. He falls for a much younger man, and they go on quite the trip. Pic is 78% certified fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes. The Oscar nominated Guadagnino saw his biggest opening at the box office with the Zendaya tennis romantic drama, Challengers, back in the spring with $15M.\n\nAs many supp today, moviegoing is expected to be off -44% today to around $51M before soaring to what is expected to be a record $100M+ Black Friday. Not only do people shop, but they go to the movies, too. The best Black Friday was in 2013 according to Comscore when all pics grossed $85M, led by Lionsgate’s The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\n\nWednesday and weekend estimates:\n\nMoana 2 (Dis) 4200 theaters, Wed $57.5M 3-day $116M 5-day $175M/Wk 1\n\n2.Wicked (Uni) 3,888 theaters, Wed $20.4M, 3-day $63.3M (-44%), 5-day $97.1M/Total $242M/Wk 2\n\n3.Gladiator 2 (Par) 3,580 theaters, Wed $6.6M 3-day $28M (-49%), 5-day $40M, Total $107.2M/Wk 2\n\nRed One (AMZ MGM) 3344 theaters, Wed $2.8M 3-day $12.4M (-6%), 5-day $18M, Total $75.3M/Wk 3 Best Christmas Pageant Ever (LG) 1,777 theaters, Wed $840K 3-day $4M (+18%) 5-day $5.5M Total $32.6M/Wk 4 Venom: The Last Dance (Sony) 1,716 theaters, Wed $500K 3-day $2.4M (-37%) 5-day $3.3M Total $138M/Wk 6 Bonhoeffer…(Angel) 1,900 theaters, Wed $500K 3-day $2.1M (-58%) 5-day $3.1M Total $9.3M/Wk 2 Heretic (A24) 1622 theaters, Wed $278K 3-day $1.3M (-38%) 5-day $1.8M Total $27M/Wk 4 The Wild Robot (Uni) 935 theaters Wed $180K 3-day $550K (-74%) 5-day $840K Total $142.3M/Wk 10\n\n10.)

And if there’s one thing about Thanksgiving forecasts, they always get over-projected.\n\nRight now, Disney’s Moana 2 is putting up an estimated $54M first day, inclusive of Tuesday’s Walt Disney Animation preview record of $13.8M. This will coast the Dwayne Johnson-Auli’i Cravalho sequel to at least $170M at 4,200 theaters, easily a Thanksgiving 5-day record opening, unseating Disney’s own Frozen ($93.9M), as well as a movie with the biggest haul over the holiday stretch, topping Frozen 2 ($125M). The 3-day for Moana 2 is somewhere around $90M-$100M+.\n\nLet’s just keep a tab on this: The best opening for Johnson at the domestic box office is Furious 7 at $147.1M in 2015.\n\nThis is Disney’s fourth blockbuster north of $100M+ domestic under the Alan Bergman team after Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes; Inside Out 2, the highest-grossing movie of the year; and Deadpool & Wolverine, the top-grossing R-rated movie of all time.\n\nRELATED: The Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Box Office: Photo Gallery\n\nNow, some rivals easily see $200M+ over the Wednesday-Sunday period, and if Moana 2 crosses that threshold, the sequel would squash pervious 5-day opening recordholder The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($204.6M) like a turtle. Keep in mind the first day here for Moana 2 bests the first day of that Illumination/Nintendo title at $31.7M — but that pic didn’t have any previews. Black out Moana 2‘s previews, and the surfer girl is at $40.2M currently.\n\n‘Grease’ is not the word …’Wicked’ is.\n\nWe’re not done yet…\n\nWicked by Sunday will stand at $236.9M, arguably the best ever stateside for a movie based on a Broadway musical, burying Grease ($190M). The 5-day on Wicked is estimated at $92M. Today is $18.5M, the pic’s highest weekday so far, +11% over Tuesday, which will plow into a $61M second weekend, -46% at 3,888 theaters. The production cost for both parts of Wicked is $320M before P&A.\n\nRELATED: ‘Wicked – Part One’: All The Box Office Records Broken\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParamount’s Gladiator 2 at 3,580 sites is posting another $6.7M today, for a second weekend of $27.3M, -50% and 5-day of $39.4M and a running total of $106.6M for the $250M feature production.\n\nSome are getting their double dose of The Rock this weekend, also heading to Amazon MGM Studios’ Christmas actioner Red One, which is eyeing a $3M Wednesday, $13M third weekend, -1%, $19M 5-day and running total of $76.3M.\n\nRELATED: 10 Most Anticipated Movies In Theaters At The End Of The Year: From ‘Glicked’ Dual Release To ‘A Complete Unknown’\n\nLionsgate’s fourth weekend of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever at 1,832 locations is seeing $950K today, $3.9M over three days (+14%), 5-day $5.7M and running total of $32.8M.\n\nRemember, the biggest Thanksgiving five-day Wednesday-Sunday frame for all titles belongs to 2018, when Ralph Breaks the Internet opened to No. 1, that period amassing $315.6M per Comscore. It’s looking like we could easily eclipse that benchmark.\n\nRELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Box Office: Photo Gallery"

      "full_content": "A new so-called “reasoning” AI model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has arrived on the scene. It’s one of the few to rival OpenAI’s o1, and it’s the first available to download under a permissive license.\n\nDeveloped by Alibaba’s Qwen team, QwQ-32B-Preview contains 32.5 billion parameters and can consider prompts up ~32,000 words in length; it performs better on certain benchmarks than o1-preview and o1-mini, the two reasoning models that OpenAI has released so far. (Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters. OpenAI does not disclose the parameter count for its models.)\n\nPer Alibaba’s testing, QwQ-32B-Preview beats OpenAI’s o1-preview model on the AIME and MATH tests. AIME uses other AI models to evaluate a model’s performance, while MATH is a collection of word problems.\n\nQwQ-32B-Preview can solve logic puzzles and answer reasonably challenging math questions, thanks to its “reasoning” capabilities. But it isn’t perfect. Alibaba notes in a blog post that the model might switch languages unexpectedly, get stuck in loops, and underperform on tasks that require “common sense reasoning.”\n\nImage Credits:Alibaba\n\nUnlike most AI, QwQ-32B-Preview and other reasoning models effectively fact-check themselves. This helps them avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models, with the downside being that they often take longer to arrive at solutions. Similar to o1, QwQ-32B-Preview reasons through tasks, planning ahead and performing a series of actions that help the model tease out answers.\n\nQwQ-32B-Preview, which can be run on and downloaded from the AI dev platform Hugging Face, appears to be similar to the recently released DeepSeek reasoning model in that it treads lightly around certain political subjects. Alibaba and DeepSeek, being Chinese companies, are subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure their models’ responses “embody core socialist values.” Many Chinese AI systems decline to respond to topics that might raise the ire of regulators, like speculation about the Xi Jinping regime.\n\nImage Credits:Alibaba\n\nAsked “Is Taiwan a part of China?,” QwQ-32B-Preview answered that it was (and “inalienable” as well) — a perspective out of step with most of the world but in line with that of China’s ruling party. Prompts about Tiananmen Square, meanwhile, yielded a non-response.\n\nImage Credits:Alibaba\n\nQwQ-32B-Preview is “openly” available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used for commercial applications. But only certain components of the model have been released, making it impossible to replicate QwQ-32B-Preview or gain much insight into the system’s inner workings. The “openness” of AI models is not a settled question, but there is a general continuum from more closed (API access only) to more open (model, weights, data disclosed) and this one falls in the middle somewhere.\n\nThe increased attention on reasoning models comes as the viability of “scaling laws,” long-held theories that throwing more data and computing power at a model would continuously increase its capabilities, are coming under scrutiny. A flurry of press reports suggest that models from major AI labs including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic aren’t improving as dramatically as they once did.\n\nThat has led to a scramble for new AI approaches, architectures, and development techniques, one of which is test-time compute. Also known as inference compute, test-time compute essentially gives models extra processing time to complete tasks, and underpins models like o1 and QwQ-32B-Preview. .\n\nBig labs besides OpenAI and Chinese firms are betting test-time compute is the future. According to a recent report from The Information, Google has expanded an internal team focused on reasoning models to about 200 people, and added substantial compute power to the effort."

      "full_content": "IU’s lack of preparation, plan and adjustments exposed in 28-point loss to Louisville Will Foley Nov 27, 2024 4:07 pm in Media\n\nNASSAU, Bahamas – As Indiana basketball trailed by 30+ points in a thumping against Louisville to open the Battle 4 Atlantis Wednesday, head coach Mike Woodson stood still, arms on his hips, before taking a seat on the bench for the remainder of the game. All the while, first-year Louisville head coach Pat Kelsey continued to bark orders and directions to his team.\n\nIn an 89-61 game whose final score generously understated the true product, Woodson’s Hoosiers looked hopelessly unprepared and unable to make key adjustments. With another two games to play in the next two days, this raises concerns about how competitive Indiana will be in closing out the neutral-site tournament.\n\n“It was beyond schemes,” Woodson said postgame. “As a coach, I’ve got to get this team more ready to go, and I’m talking beginning to end.”\n\nLouisville opted to start smaller and more perimeter-oriented than usual – although Kelsey later admitted starting big man James Scott didn’t start due to being late to shootaround – and Woodson stayed with his usual two-big lineup. When Oumar Ballo was stripped by Chucky Hepburn, which led to a transition layup on the game’s first possession, it was a bad omen of what was to come.\n\nHepburn and Louisville’s guards had Indiana’s backcourt locked up in chains and the Hoosiers’ size was the only offensive facet keeping them alive. Despite the size advantage, Indiana still struggled to keep up with the Cardinals, even in areas where its only advantage should have shown. For example, Louisville completely outhustled the Hoosiers for four offensive rebounds on one possession early.\n\nIt was prevalent early on that Kelsey and the Cardinals had a plan of attack on how to shut down the Hoosiers: space the floor, get out in transition and control the pace of the game. Defensively, it was to prevent Indiana from getting transition momentum.\n\n“We just thought our advantage was being able to space the floor, play with great pace and generate offense that way,” Kelsey said. “You know, every team is going to play to their strengths.”\n\nOn the contrary, Woodson and the Hoosiers did try to play to their strengths and relied on the post offense. However, even once it became clear that adjustments were needed in order to compete with Louisville, there was no change in approach.\n\nDespite looking outmatched and being outplayed in nearly all areas of the game, Indiana still managed to enter halftime trailing by just 8 points. Woodson was graced with an opportunity to regroup at the break and figure out how to run with Louisville or slow them down. Spoiler alert: it didn’t happen.\n\nThe Hoosiers scored first to open the half, then in the blink of an eye, an 11-0 Louisville run busted the game open. One run after another and it became too late for Indiana to stop any bleeding. With seven minutes remaining, the biggest concern was to not lose by 40+ and get embarrassed on national television.\n\nIndiana’s four-guard rotation combined to shoot 0-for-18 with eight turnovers before a Myles Rice 3-pointer received a generous bounce off the rim and went in. Outside of Ballo and Malik Reneau, the Hoosiers shot 9-for-43 from the field. The team shot 4-for-19 on layups and finished with more turnovers (23) than field goals (21). Whatever your choice of stat from Indiana, it was so pathetic it didn’t even seem possible.\n\nAnd despite all of it, Woodson’s only response was the team “didn’t play Indiana basketball” and needs to learn from its mistakes and prepare for tomorrow. While he at least took accountability for the result and owned his responsibility to prevent another similar performance, he had no explanation for how the team was outcoached, outhustled and outplayed.\n\nEven Reneau – who was the Hoosiers’ sole bright spot with 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists – could only cite a lack of execution.\n\n“We had a great scout going into the game,” Reneau said. “We just didn’t execute the game plan that Coach Woodson had, especially on the defensive end. It was just, like, a lack of focus towards the scout we had and not giving it all out when we were on the court.”\n\nWednesday’s result marks four consecutive 20-plus point drubbings in Woodson’s past four losses in a neutral-site contest. When the lights have been the brightest in a square environment – even though there was a clear edge of Hoosier fans in Atlantis – the Hoosiers have failed to show up by any measure.\n\nWith the loser of No. 3 Gonzaga and 3-1 West Virginia up next, Indiana has some serious evaluating to do. One game won’t define this team’s season and the direction it’s going in, but that’s only if some sort of adjustments are made. And based off Wednesday afternoon, when it was apparent adjustments were needed, there’s no guarantee what will happen next.\n\n(Photo credit: IU Athletics)\n\nFiled to: Louisville Cardinals"

      "full_content": "An illustration of the Europa Clipper spacecraft with its solar arrays, magnetometer's boom and several antennas for the radar instrument deployed.\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper mission has successfully deployed two of its science instruments as it makes its way to the Jupiter system.\n\nLaunched on Oct. 14, the Europa Clipper spacecraft is currently en route to study Jupiter's icy moon Europa , which is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean. The mission lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. It has since ventured 13 million miles (20 million kilometers) from Earth, traveling at a speed of 22 miles per second (35 kilometers per second) relative to the sun, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n\"Europa Clipper is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission,\" NASA officials said in the statement . \"It will travel 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers) to arrive at Jupiter in 2030 and in 2031 will begin a series of 49 flybys, using a suite of instruments to gather data that will tell scientists if the icy moon and its internal ocean have the conditions needed to harbor life.\"\n\nThe spacecraft has so far operated as expected, having deployed its massive solar arrays shortly after launch. The solar arrays, which extend the length of a basketball court, collect sunlight to power the spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter , and during its science work in the Jovian system.\n\nRelated: SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launches NASA's Europa Clipper probe to explore icy Jupiter ocean moon (video)\n\nRecently, the magnetometer's boom and several antennas for the spacecraft's radar instrument were deployed and will remain extended from the spacecraft for the full duration of the mission.\n\nMeasuring 28 feet (8.5 meters), the boom uncoiled from a canister mounted on the spacecraft body. Sensors paired with the hardware confirmed the deployment was successful. Once the spacecraft reaches Jupiter, the magnetometer will be used to measure the magnetic field around Europa. This will help scientists confirm the existence of the ocean believed to lie beneath the moon's icy crust and measure its depth and salinity, according to the statement.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Engineering data transmitted back from the spacecraft allows the mission team to assess how the hardware is operating.\n\n\"It's an exciting time on the spacecraft, getting these key deployments done,\" Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in the statement. \"Most of what the team is focusing on now is understanding the small, interesting things in the data that help them understand the behavior of the spacecraft on a deeper level. That's really good to see.\"\n\nThe team will continue to check the spacecraft's hardware, with seven more instruments expected to power on and off in a series of tests planned for December and January.\n\nTo reach Jupiter, Clipper will perform a few gravity assists by looping around Mars and then back around Earth. This maneuver allows the spacecraft to leverage a planet's gravitational pull to gain speed and alter its trajectory."

Experts say it won't be the last.\n\nYet what exactly caused the smell, and just how hazardous it was, remains unclear. Reports from the website Russian Space Web claim that the fumes released were \"toxic\". Nonetheless, astronauts opened the hatch on Monday (Nov. 25) to find that the unusual odor had come from the \"outgassing from materials\" inside Progress's pressurized cargo section, NASA representatives told CNN .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

According to a recent NASA report , a mysterious five-year leak to the module has intensified to the point that it could lead to the \"catastrophic failure\" of the station , said Bob Cabana , the chair of NASA's ISS Advisory Committee. Russian officials downplayed the claim, and so far little has been done to address the problem.\n\nRegardless, not much time remains until the ISS is put out of commission. The station's operational life will continue until 2030, after which it will be pushed out of orbit by SpaceX to burn up in Earth's atmosphere."

      "full_content": "Elon Musk has taken to posting the identities of relatively unknown government officials and federal workers whose jobs he wants to eliminate, and his followers are taking it upon themselves to harass and threaten those they can find.\n\nFollowing a series of posts from Musk earlier this week highlighting the names and titles of federal workers whose jobs he called “fake,” the targets of his social media activity are facing a barrage of online abuse, according to a report from CNN on Wednesday. Many of the employees highlighted by Musk do not have public-facing jobs, and they have done nothing other than hold a title that displeases the billionaire who’s anointed himself Donald Trump’s co-president and is expected to help the president-elect slash government bureaucracy.\n\nCNN’s review of Musk’s prolific posting habits found that over the course of the past week, the billionaire boosted posts on his website revealing the names and job titles of four federal employees working in climate policy and regulation. The four targets were all women, and Musk — who owns the electric vehicle company Tesla — has a vested interest in climate policy.\n\nIn one instance, Musk quote-tweeted a post highlighting the role of a woman who works as a “Director of Climate Diversification” at the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. (DFC), a relatively obscure government agency. “So many fake jobs,” Musk captioned his repost.\n\nA self-styled “anti-woke” crusader, Musk likely took the word “diversification” to mean the “D” in “DEI.” A spokesperson for the DFC told The Wall St. Journal earlier this week that the employee — who holds degrees in engineering, business, and water science from Oxford and MIT — serves a highly technical role focused on identifying innovative solutions to help protect American agriculture and infrastructure from the effects of natural disasters.\n\nCNN’s investigation found that the employee had shut down several of her social media accounts following Musk’s tweet. Editor’s picks\n\nIn another repost — highlighting a tweet from the same account that targeted the DFC employee — Musk mocked former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s niece, who works as a senior adviser to climate change at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n“Nancy Pelosi’s niece should not be paid $181,648.00 by the U.S. Taxpayer to be the ‘Climate Advisor’ at HUD,” the original account wrote.\n\n“But maybe her advice is amazing 🤣🤣” Musk commented.\n\nThe post included the names and titles of two other employees: the Department of Energy’s chief climate officer in its loan programs office — a program that in 2010 awarded Tesla a $465 million investment — and the name of an employee serving as senior adviser on environmental justice and climate change at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe posts give a window into the type of roles Musk plans to target as the co-director of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — an unofficial department created specifically to house Musk’s promise to gut the federal bureaucracy and purge government agencies of what he considers superfluous employees.\n\nDOGE has no inherent power, and it has not been sanctioned as an official department by Congress — but according to recent reporting, Musk and his co-director, failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, have been in talks with members of the Trump transition and MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to form a congressional subcommittee tasked with converting DOGE’s recommendations into concrete legislation. Related Content\n\nMissy Cummings, a former fighter pilot and senior adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was targeted in 2021 by Musk, who claimed she “is extremely biased against Tesla.” Tesla has faced repeated scrutiny from NHTSA, dating back to at least 2021, and has been forced to issue recalls over its supposed “Full-Self Driving” and Autopilot programs.\n\nCummings told CNN that as a result of the attention from Musk and other prominent accounts affiliated with him, she had received death threats, was forced to temporarily leave her home, and deleted her X account.\n\nShe added that the climate of intimidation is already leading some longtime federal employees to leave their jobs. “He intended for them, for people just like this, to be intimidated and just go ahead and quit so he didn’t have to fire them. So his plan, to some extent, is working,” she said."

Merlin Entertainments announced Wednesday that O'Neil had informed its board that he is leaving for \"another opportunity\" and stepping down as CEO at the end of the year.\n\nNorman, 69, had previously said he expects to remain with LIV Golf in some capacity. He told Sports Illustrated that his contract with the circuit ends in August 2025.\n\nA LIV Golf spokesman declined comment when reached by ESPN on Wednesday.\n\nSports Business Journal first reported that LIV Golf was targeting O'Neil for the position.\n\nNorman, a two-time Open Championship winner, helped reshape men's professional golf by recruiting PGA Tour players to the breakaway circuit, which has been financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund the past three years.\n\nNorman helped lure major champions Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Cameron Smith, Brooks Koepka, Jon Rahm and others to the new league with guaranteed contracts worth more than $100 million.\n\nO'Neill also worked as the president of Madison Square Garden and was an employee of the NBA.\n\nThe PGA Tour and the PIF have been in negotiations for months about a deal that would inject more than $1 billion from the PIF into PGA Tour Enterprises, the new for-profit entity launched by the tour and Strategic Sports Group.\n\nThe PGA Tour, DP World Tour and PIF signed a framework agreement on June 6, 2023, to form an alliance.

      "full_content": "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.\n\n\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"\n\nIt turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.\n\nThe base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.\n\nA view of the main trench into the U.S. military's base in Greenland, Century Camp, is seen during construction of the facility in a Jan. 1, 1950, file photo. Pictorial Parade/Archive Photos/Getty\n\nWhile the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.\n\n\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nPast scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.\n\nA photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.\n\nA composite image shared by NASA's Earth Observatory on Nov. 25, 2024 shows, at top, a view of the Greenland Ice Sheet taken from the window of a NASA Gulfstream III plane in April 2024 and, below, imagery created using data from a UAVSAR radar unit on the plane, revealing structural elements of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base buried under the ice. NASA Earth Observatory/Michala Garrison, Jesse Allen, Chad Greene\n\n\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth — part of an effort to estimate when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could re-expose the camp and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"\n\nA 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.\n\nCBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"\n\nCBS News' Walter Cronkite is seen on the Greenland Ice Sheet during a visit to Camp Century, for a CBS documentary program that aired in 1961. CBS\n\nThe exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" (An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)\n\nSpeaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\n\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\""

      "full_content": "If you're looking forward to a delicious — and safe — Thanksgiving dinner with loved ones, it's important to follow proper precautions when cooking.\n\n\"A Thanksgiving meal, particularly involving a turkey, requires careful attention to food safety to prevent contamination and foodborne illness,\" food safety expert Darin Detwiler, a professor at Northeastern University, told CBS News. \"A raw turkey can introduce harmful bacteria into your kitchen, including salmonella and campylobacter ... These bacteria can spread through juices from the turkey onto countertops, utensils and other foods, leading to cross-contamination.\"\n\nEvery year, foodborne illness causes 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths nationwide, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nLuckily, there are \"simple steps we can all take at home that will help reduce the risk of foodborne illness,\" the USDA notes on its website.\n\nHere's what to know to perfect your bird for the big day.\n\nWhat internal temperature should you cook turkey to?\n\nNo matter how you're cooking your turkey — roasting, deep frying, smoking or something else — the minimum internal temperature should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit for safety, according to the USDA.\n\nHitting this temperature helps ensure any bacteria like E. coli, listeria or salmonella is killed off before you feast.\n\nWhere in the turkey should you put your thermometer to measure internal temperature?\n\nThe innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast are the best places to check the internal temperature of a turkey with a food thermometer, according to the USDA.\n\nYou should measure the temperature even if your turkey has a \"pop-up\" temperature indicator, the agency recommends.\n\n\"Take care to ensure the thermometer does not touch any bones while measuring the temperature, as this will give an inaccurate reading,\" its website notes.\n\nHow to tell your turkey is done if you don't have a meat thermometer\n\n\"Using a food thermometer is the only reliable way to verify that the turkey has reached this safe temperature,\" said Detwiler. \"Visual cues, such as color or texture, are not sufficient to determine doneness because undercooked poultry can appear cooked in some cases.\"\n\nThe USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Services provides a Turkey Thawing Calculator and Turkey Cooking Calculator on its website help home chefs gauge how long their turkey needs to cook.\n\nBut, a lot of variables can affect the roasting time of a whole turkey, including whether or not it's stuffed, if the oven temperature is accurate, what the roasting pan is made from and more, the service notes.\n\nTo ensure any harmful bacteria in your food has been killed before you eat it, use a food thermometer to verify its temperature.\n\n\"Ensuring the turkey reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit protects against foodborne illness and keeps your meal safe for all guests, particularly vulnerable populations like children, elderly individuals, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals,\" Detwiler said.\n\nHow long are Thanksgiving leftovers safe to eat?\n\nLeftovers should be refrigerated within 2 hours of serving to prevent food poisoning, according to the U.S. Food Safety website.\n\n\"Cooked turkey and dishes made with turkey, such as a casserole, can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or can be frozen to store longer,\" the website notes, adding all leftovers should be reheated to at least 165 degrees before serving.\n\nIf you store leftovers in the freezer, they will remain \"of best quality for up to two to six months,\" according to the USDA.\n\n\"Avoid reheating leftovers more than once to reduce foodborne illness risk,\" Detwiler said."

      "full_content": "It’s that time of year when people might be looking to upgrade their phones. In 2024, we had 5 brand new Google Pixel phones to contend with—plus the previous generations sticking around—but how do you decide which is right for you? Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nAs 2024 steadily comes to a close, Google’s Pixel 8a, Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold take up substantial space on the firm’s digital storefront. The pricing structure has evolved, and the lineup has improved, but there are key differences that help separate each device.\n\nThe Pixel 8a has one foot in the previous generation. It’s bubbly, rounded, and shares more of its DNA with the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro. The Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold are going to be the flagbearers from 2024 until – hopefully – late 2025.\n\nWhat size smartphone do you want?\n\nThe easiest way to determine which Pixel you should buy in 2024 is to determine what size phone you want. If you want a smaller phone, you will also need to work out what display size you are happy with.\n\nWhile the Pixel 8a has the smallest 6.1-inch display in 2024, its dimensions are very similar to those of the Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro. Larger bezels and a mostly plastic chassis also make the 8a around 10g lighter than the base Pixel 9 and 9 Pro. It might not seem like much, but once you put a case and screen protector on your device, it adds up.\n\nAnother consideration is the shape. Because the Pixel 8a is based on last year’s flagship phones, it has rounded corners and a bubbly aesthetic. The 9 series has adopted a boxier shape, which means flat sides with sharper edges. Also, the camera bar looks different. Does that matter? Well, that is ultimately up to you.\n\nPixel 8a Pixel 9 Pixel 9 Pro Pixel 9 Pro XL Pixel 9 Pro Fold Size 6.1-inches 6.3-inches* 6.3-inches 6.8-inches Closed: 6.3-inches\n\nOpen: 8-inches Resolution 1080 x 2400 pixels 1080 x 2424 pixels 1280 x 2856 pixels 1344 x 2992 pixels Outer: 1080 x 2424 pixels\n\nInner: 2076 x 2152 pixels Refresh rate 120Hz 120Hz 120Hz 120Hz 120Hz Dimensions 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9mm (5.99 x 2.86 x 0.35in) 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm (6.02 x 2.83 x 0.33in) 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm (6.02 x 2.83 x 0.33in) 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm (6.41 x 3.02 x 0.33in)\n\nClosed: 155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5mm\n\nOpen: 155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1mm Weight 188g (6.63oz) 198g (6.98oz) 199g (7.02oz) 221g (7.80oz) 257g (9.07oz)\n\nChoosing between the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro is less straightforward. This is the first time that Google has made two devices with identical dimensions. They technically have the exact same screen sizes. Realistically, the 9 has a slightly smaller screen because it has slightly larger screen bezels by just a fraction of a millimeter.\n\nThe upside if that, finally, we have a “Pro” tier phone that is small and doesn’t lose out on camera hardware and features. The Pixel 9 Pro is new for 2024 and comes with all of the same core internals as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. So, you can have the “best of Pixel” but in a smaller package. It does have a smaller battery to account for the diminished dimensions.\n\nIf you want a dual-purpose phone, the Pixel Fold has the largest 8-inch internal screen. The outer screen is actually the same size as the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro—at 6.3 inches. However, the biggest phone is the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This is the biggest Pixel to date in size and stature and has all of the best hardware to boot.\n\nWhat specifications do you need?\n\nSometimes, the base model is more than enough for most people, and getting something with insane specifications can be overkill. Credit to Google this year; there is less confusion based on specs for 2024 Pixel phones.\n\nIf you are content with a smooth experience and don’t care about tons of storage options or raw power, the Pixel 8a may have last year’s processor and less RAM, but it will be a solid performer. The performance uplift from Tensor G3 to G4 is very minimal too.\n\nPixel 8a Pixel 9 Pixel 9 Pro Pixel 9 Pro XL Pixel 9 Pro Fold Processor Tensor G3 Tensor G4 Tensor G4 Tensor G4 Tensor G4 Memory 8GB 12GB 16GB 16GB 16GB Storage 128 / 256GB 128 / 256GB 128 / 256 / 512 / 1TB 128 / 256 / 512 / 1TB 256 / 512GB\n\nThe Pixel 9 is the entry-level model in the 9 series for 2024. It offers fewer storage options and 4GB less RAM, which could make it worse for specific AI-related tasks. That said, with the launch of Android 15, performance is practically identical to that of the Pixel 9 Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold.\n\nIf you need or want the most storage, you have two options: Pixel 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL. These phones have a unique 1TB storage variant that is unavailable on all other models.\n\nWhat do you want from a camera system?\n\nGoogle has always offered a competitive and compelling camera system on Pixel phones. They are lauded and loved for the unique characteristics of images – and now video. At the low end, the Pixel 8a is objectively the least capable Google camera system for 2024. The combination of a smaller main sensor and lower-resolution ultra-wide make it a great basic point-and-shoot smartphone.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold utilizes the same main sensor and the same ultra-wide-angle lens as part of its camera array. Because it has a dedicated 5x telephoto zoom lens, it can be more flexible than the base Pixel 9.\n\nPixel 8a Pixel 9 Pixel 9 Pro Pixel 9 Pro XL Pixel 9 Pro Fold Main 64MP\n\nf1.9 50MP\n\nf1.7 50MP\n\nf1.7 50MP\n\nf1.7 64MP\n\nf1.9 Secondary sensor 13MP ultra-wide-angle\n\nf2.2 aperture\n\n120˚ FOV 48MP ultra-wide-angle\n\nf1.7 aperture\n\n123˚ FOV 48MP ultra-wide-angle\n\nf1.7 aperture\n\n123˚ FOV 48MP ultra-wide-angle\n\nf1.7 aperture\n\n123˚ FOV 10.5MP ultra-wide-angle\n\nf2.2\n\n127˚ FOV Tertiary sensor – – 48MP\n\n5x optical zoom\n\nf2.8 48MP\n\n5x optical zoom\n\nf2.8 10.8MP\n\n5x optical zoom\n\nf3.1 Front-facing sensor 13MP\n\nf2.2 10.5MP\n\nf2.2 42MP\n\nf2.2 42MP\n\nf2.2 10MP\n\nf2.2 Camera software features Super Res Zoom up to 8x\n\nReal Tone\n\nMagic Editor\n\nBest Take\n\nMagic Eraser\n\nPhoto Unblur\n\nAudio Magic Eraser\n\n\n\nSuper Res Zoom up to 30x\n\nGuided Frame\n\n8K at 30fps (Video Boost)\n\n4K UHD 60fps (all lenses)\n\n10-bit HDR10 Video\n\nSuper Res Zoom Video up to 20x\n\nReal Tone\n\nMagic Editor\n\nBest Take\n\nMagic Eraser\n\nPhoto Unblur\n\nAudio Magic Eraser\n\nZoom Enhance Super Res Zoom up to 30x\n\nGuided Frame\n\n8K at 30fps (Video Boost)\n\n4K UHD 60fps (all lenses)\n\n10-bit HDR10 Video\n\nSuper Res Zoom Video up to 20x\n\nReal Tone\n\nMagic Editor\n\nBest Take\n\nMagic Eraser\n\nPhoto Unblur\n\nAudio Magic Eraser\n\nZoom Enhance\n\nThe Pixel 9 ships with a dual lens system at the rear. It consists of the same main sensor and ultra-wide as the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. Unfortunately, the selfie camera is lower resolution at 10.5MP, but still supports Face Unlock.\n\nAt the top of the totem for 2024 you’ll find the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. The duo sport the exact same setup. A 50MP main sensor, 48MP ultrawide, improved 48MP 5x telephoto plus a new 42MP selfie camera for better front-facing photos and videos. If you want the “complete” camera experience the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL are essential.\n\nOnly these two devices are capable of recording 8K video with Video Boost. They also have enhanced zoom capabilities up to 30x and better zoom video at up to 20x. There are Pro modes here, too, for enhanced manual controls.\n\nTL;DR – Which Pixel device should I choose?\n\nCompared to last year, Google has really up the pricing for Pixel phones in 2024. The cheapest device released this year starts at $500. Sure, discounts can bring the Pixel 8a as low as $399, but when you consider that the Pixel 8 is a better version of the A-series handset and is cheaper than ever, I would look at that unit.\n\nThe Pixel 9 now starts at $799, a $100 jump. You get an overall better smartphone, but at $200 more, the Pixel 9 Pro is a far better buy if you can stomach the further $200 uptick. Make no mistake $999 is expensive, but it is one of the few small flagship phones you can buy that doesn’t have clipped wings.\n\nPixel 8a Pixel 9 Pixel 9 Pro Pixel 9 Pro XL Pixel 9 Pro Fold Price $499 / £499 / €549 $799 / £799 / €849 $999 / £999 / €1,099 $1,099 / £1,099 / €1, 149 $1,799 / £1,749 / €1,899\n\nAnother thing to note is that the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a whopping $1,099 this time around for the base 128GB variant. In global regions, it’s even more expensive and, a little like the 9 Pro, is harder to recommend at the base retail pricing.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not going to be the best device for most people. It’s almost $2,000 and while it has the benefits of a dual-purpose form factor, there are downgrades that might not be worth it for most people.\n\nIf you don’t want to buy the latest devices, you’re not limited to the 2024 Pixel launch cohort. Google still offers the Pixel 8, 8 Pro, and Pixel 7a directly from the firm’s official store. These can be purchased at significant discounts and still offer extensive support windows and impressive functions. You’ll miss out on some AI goodies, but the core Android experience is practically unchanged.\n\nIf you are unsure which device is right for you, you can use the great built-in comparison tool on the Google Store. It’ll give you some key information to help streamline the buying decision.\n\nYou can pick up the Pixel 9 series at Amazon, Best Buy, Google Store, Walmart, and many more."

      "full_content": "Paleontologists have long puzzled over how the dinosaurs—originally relatively small and of minor importance to the broader ecosystem—evolved to become the dominant species some 30 million years later. Fossilized feces and vomit from dinosaurs might hold important clues to how and why this evolutionary milestone came about, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature.\n\nCo-author Martin Qvarnström, an evolutionary biologist with Uppsala University in Sweden, and his collaborators studied trace fossils known as bromalites, a designation that includes coprolites as well as vomit or other fossilized matter from an organism's digestive tract. As previously reported, coprolites aren't quite the same as paleofeces, which retain a lot of organic components that can be reconstituted and analyzed for chemical properties. Coprolites are fossils, so most organic components have been replaced by mineral deposits like silicate and calcium carbonates.\n\nFor archaeologists keen on learning more about the health and diet of past populations—as well as how certain parasites evolved in the evolutionary history of the microbiome—coprolites and paleofeces can be a veritable goldmine of information. For instance, in 2021 we reported on an analysis of preserved paleo-poop revealing that ancient Iron Age miners in what is now Austria were fond of beer and blue cheese.\n\nIf a coprolite contains bone fragments, chances are the animal who excreted it was a carnivore, and tooth marks on those fragments can tell us something about how the animal may have eaten its prey. The size and shape of coprolites can also yield useful insights. If a coprolite is spiral-shaped, for instance, it might have been excreted by an ancient shark, since some modern fish (like sharks) have spiral-shaped intestines.\n\nA tale of two models\n\nExcavations in the Late Triassic locality at Lisowice, Poland. The site yielded a large number of coprolites of predators and herbivores. Credit: Krystian Balanda\n\nQvarnström et al. were keen to test two competing hypotheses about the dinosaurs' rise to dominance from the Late Triassic Period (237 million to 201 million years ago) to the onset of the Jurassic Period between 201 million to 145 million years ago. \"No single hypothesis seems capable of explaining the rise of dinosaurs fully and critical questions about how dinosaurs established their dynasty on land remain largely unanswered,\" the authors wrote about their research objectives.\n\nOne hypothesis cites evolutionary competition—the traditional \"competitive replacement\" model—as a driving factor, in which dinosaurs were better equipped to survive thanks to superior physiologies, anatomical adaptations, and feeding habits. Alternatively the \"opportunistic replacement\" model suggests that the dinosaurs were better able to adapt to a rapidly changing environment brought about by random processes—volcanic eruptions, climate change, or other catastrophic events that led to the decline and/or extinction of other species."
