      "full_content": "A tech rally pushed the major indexes to new highs last week as the latest economic data releases did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its final meeting of 2024.\n\nIn the first week of December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the lone index in the red, falling about 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a crucial reading of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is slated for release on Wednesday. A reading on wholesale inflation, the Producer Price Index (PPI), will follow on Thursday.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly results from Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), C3.ai (AI), and GameStop (GME) will highlight a quiet week of scheduled company updates.\n\n• USD (^DJI) View Quote Details\n\nA 'significant' inflation print\n\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed 227,000 new jobs were created in November, just above the 220,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%. At large, the release didn't shift economist and investor thinking that the labor market is cooling but not at a rapid pace that would alter the Fed's interest rate-cutting path.\n\n\"The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but next week’s CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,\" BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder wrote on Friday,\n\n\"The CPI and PPI price data next week will be the main determinant of the Fed’s interest rate decision this month,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown.\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 85% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at the DealBook Summit in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe final CPI release before the Fed's meeting is expected to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 2.7% annually in November, an increase from the 2.6% in October. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, above the 0.2% month-over-month increase in September.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.3% over last year in November. This would mark the fourth straight month of a 3.3% reading of core CPI. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the October gain.\n\n\"The disinflationary momentum is fading, and new headwinds (e.g., the potential for tariffs and tax cuts) have emerged that make the final leg of inflation's journey back to the Fed's 2% target look increasingly difficult,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note. \"The stubborn picture of inflation that has surfaced over the past few months is unlikely to be altered by the November CPI report.\""

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nFor the latest developments, read our new story.\n\nNYPD divers were searching a body of water in New York’s Central Park on Saturday for the firearm used in the fatal shooting of a health care executive in Manhattan, a law enforcement official told CNN, as the search for the gunman nears the end of its fourth day.\n\nThe divers were seen in water known as the Lake, near the park’s iconic boathouse and Bethesda Fountain, the official said.\n\nAt least two key pieces of evidence in the Wednesday killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson continued to evade investigators Saturday, including an electric bike the suspect rode and the gun used in the killing.\n\nOn Friday evening, authorities found a backpack in the park which will be tested at a forensic lab in Queens, a law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nNo gun was found in the backpack believed to have belonged to the gunman, law enforcement officials said Saturday. Authorities have yet to officially confirm the bag’s origins, an official told CNN Friday.\n\nThe Peak Design backpack contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, according to the officials. It was not immediately clear if other items were in the backpack, officials said.\n\nFederal investigators are assisting the NYPD as they piece together clues, including the backpack, photos, video, ammunition, DNA and more, to help zero in on a suspect they believe is no longer in the city.\n\nThe FBI says it is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the gunman.\n\n“We are seeking the public’s help in identifying the unknown suspect responsible for the homicide,” the FBI said Friday in an agency news release. The NYPD is also offering a reward of up to $10,000, the department said in a social media post Thursday.\n\nThe shooting suspect, believed to have left New York City on an interstate bus, has not been identified or located following the shooting police believe was “definitely planned,” NYPD officials told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe suspect traveled to New York City last month on a Greyhound bus that began its route in Atlanta, officials have said.\n\nOn Saturday, detectives from the NYPD arrived in Atlanta to help further the investigation, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN. The Atlanta Police Department has said it is assisting New York police.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Saturday cited the backpack’s discovery as “obviously a positive development.”\n\n“Let him continue to believe he can hide behind a mask,” Adams said of the suspect. “We’re going to reveal who he is, and we’re going to bring him to justice.”\n\nThe NYPD released images taken at a hostel of an unmasked shooting suspect. Officials have performed extensive video canvassing, leading them to the hostel in Upper Manhattan, a police official told CNN. NYPD\n\nInvestigators are focused on identifying the unmasked man pictured in surveillance images released Thursday which authorities say offers a significant clue in the search. Investigators appear to be homing in on the possible identity of the suspect, two people briefed on the investigation said, but are still working to verify the information and are not yet certain they know his identity.\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told CNN on Friday authorities have gathered “a huge amount of evidence,” including fingerprints, DNA evidence and a “massive camera canvass” of the suspect’s movements throughout the city.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether the shooter used a specialized weapon in the killing, Joseph Kenny, the chief detective of the NYPD, told reporters Friday.\n\n“This isn’t ‘Blue Bloods.’ We’re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We’re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across,” Kenny said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have briefed border guards on both sides of the US border with Canada and Mexico to be on the lookout for the suspect, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told CNN.\n\nUpon his arrival in New York on November 24, the suspect took a cab from the Port Authority bus terminal to the vicinity of the Hilton Hotel and stayed there for about half an hour, he said.\n\nInvestigators say the suspect then used a fake New Jersey driver’s license to check into an Upper West Side hostel which has since notified its guests it is cooperating with the police investigation.\n\nPhotos from the hostel along with a burner phone and water bottle believed to have been dropped by the suspect upon fleeing the Wednesday shooting scene outside the Hilton Midtown have offered investigators additional clues in the case.\n\nKenny told reporters the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets. The bullets are still being tested, he said.\n\nPolice are exploring whether the words could indicate a motive, since they are similar to a phrase commonly used to describe insurance company tactics: “Delay, deny, defend.” The phrase is also the title of a book critical of the industry.\n\n“It could possibly be a disgruntled employee or a disgruntled client,” Kenny said Friday when asked about the words on the bullets.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare, has mapped out security plans for employees in the wake of the attack.\n\n“We’re ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of our employees,” said Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group in an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by CNN.\n\nPolice appear to be homing in on suspect’s identity\n\nNYPD investigators appear to be getting closer to a possible identification of the suspected shooter, two people briefed on the investigation said late Friday.\n\nInvestigators are working to track the suspect’s potential whereabouts with the help of thousands of investigative leads, including traces of DNA which could help find the killer, the people briefed on the probe said.\n\nInvestigators are still working to verify the information as of Saturday.\n\nSome techniques have led to dead ends, with detectives unable to use facial recognition on the unmasked hostel photos to identify the shooter – possibly because of the angle of images or restrictions of the database, Kenny told reporters Friday. A fingerprint previously obtained by police was unusable for an identification, he said, adding it could be enhanced later in the investigation. Bus manifests likewise may not be helpful since identification is not required to board, according to Kenny.\n\nPolice have been able to use surveillance video to track the shooter’s movements after he arrived in New York City on November 24 and for a short time directly after the December 4 shooting. Investigators are processing video from the Port Authority in hopes of finding out what bus he got on if he did board one.\n\nThey have also contacted UnitedHealthcare’s security team to obtain its own person-of-interest list, looking for people who have been publicly vocal with complaints against the company, according to the source.\n\nThere’s no indication, however, that the shooter and CEO had any prior interactions or that the shooting was related to Thompson’s personal life, Kenny said in the Friday news briefing.\n\nPolice are asking about anyone who has used any vitriolic language and made threats, either on social media or through attendance at public demonstrations.\n\n“As we’re going through our investigation, we’re coming across a lot of online comments, a lot of online threats, things of that nature. His wife indicated that he had received some prior threats,” Kenny said.\n\nAfter a backpack believed to belong to the shooter yielded no gun, NYPD divers were sent to Central Park to see if the weapon was discarded in the water. Spectrum News NY1\n\nThe law enforcement source said most people on the list have been already been dismissed by using social media searches. The rest are being looked into for any possible ties.\n\nThe mandate is to continue to build a video timeline of every day the suspect was in the city, the source said.\n\nIdentifying the suspect is critical and multiple law enforcement agencies are offering to help in the search once an identification is made, the source added.\n\nHow the suspect carried out the deadly shooting may suggest he practiced the attack ahead of time, former FBI Special Agent Ken Gray told CNN on Saturday.\n\n“The fact that he was able to get to that location, be there in time, shoot Thompson and then get to his bike and get out of there and be on a bus out of the area, out of New York City as quickly as he did, that shows that he practiced this, that he knew what he was doing as far as his exit route from the area,” Gray said.\n\nThe suspected shooter still made errors that could help authorities track him down, according to Gray.\n\n“He made the mistake of going into the Starbucks and leaving his forensic evidence behind there with the DNA, with the fingerprints,” Gray said.\n\n“Is this guy a professional assassin? I don’t think so. But is this a person who really thought this through? I think that’s definitely the case,” he said.\n\nInvestigators carefully examining backpack believed tied to shooting\n\nInvestigators are treating the backpack found in Central Park like a dead body, being very careful not to damage any potential evidence, a law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nThe backpack was removed by an excavator along with any physical material found surrounding it, the official said. No officers picked it up, because there may be some DNA evidence tied to the backpack or even the dirt on the ground surrounding it.\n\n“Their instructions were, ‘If you find it, freeze the location, do not touch it. Wait for the detectives, wait for the crime scene unit and let them package this up,’” CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller told Anderson Cooper on Friday.\n\n“This is one of these things where even touching it or going through it with rubber gloves, you can smudge prints, move DNA, contaminate it with your own material,” Miller said.\n\nA video shows what appears to be the suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO’s shooting on West 55th Street before the killing. Gideon Platt/Stage Star Deli\n\n“When they go to trial, they want to be able to testify this was all done with perfect procedure in terms of trying to preserve that evidence and then extract that evidence,” he added.\n\nForensic investigators at a police lab in Queens will go through the contents of the bag slowly and deliberately, examining not only the contents but the bag itself, which may contain sweat or other evidence connected to the shooter, the official said.\n\nAuthorities investigating whether shooter used specialized weapon\n\nInvestigators are also looking into the possibility the gunman who killed Thompson may have used what is known as a veterinary gun, a larger firearm used on farms and ranches to put down animals without causing a loud noise, Kenny, the chief detective of the NYPD, said Friday.\n\nThe veterinary gun is based on the design of a British-made Welrod pistol, dating back to World War II, was an assassin’s weapon, Miller explained.\n\n“It’s practically silent. It’s a significant round. It’s a 9 millimeter round. And it’s meant for close-up killing. It’s meant for vets to kill an animal by shooting it in the head or somewhere, you know, that’s going to be fatal. But it would work the exact same way on humans, very effectively and extraordinarily quietly,” Miller said."

      "full_content": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad faced the most acute threat to his 24-year rule Saturday as rebels pushed into the strategic hub of Homs, seized a sweep of southern cities, and closed in on Damascus, the capital. Rebels accumulated regime territory at lighting pace as an offensive from the north, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, ignited opposition factions elsewhere in the country. Syrian troops fled en masse, according to Iraqi officials, who said at least 1,500 entered Iraq.\n\nGroups in the south seized Daraa, the birthplace of the 2011 protest movement to oust Assad, the southeastern city of Sweida and Quneitra, near the border with Israel.\n\nHTS, which has made stunning gains in the north over the past week, said Saturday evening its forces were conducting operations inside Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, around 90 miles north of Damascus. Sham FM, a news radio station that backs Assad, reported that the Syrian military was “repositioning itself to the outskirts” of the city — language it has used previously to describe withdrawals from cities and towns that have fallen to the rebels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy midnight, videos showed jubilant scenes of residents celebrating around the city’s iconic clock tower.\n\nA senior U.S. official monitoring events in Syria on Saturday said there was “significant risk” that the Assad regime would soon collapse. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, also cited warnings by Iranian and Russian officials to their citizens to prepare to evacuate the country.\n\nHTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani promised soldiers who laid down their arms would not be harmed. “The overthrow of the criminal regime is very close,” he said.\n\nThe group said it was coordinating the defections of senior officials in Damascus and had “completed arrangements” with intelligence chiefs to control the capital. Neither claim could be verified.\n\nIn the suburbs of the capital, stunned residents were panic-buying supplies as Jolani’s forces claimed they were just 12 miles outside the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the south, the Syrian military said, it had “carried out repositioning,” but officials denied withdrawing from areas around Damascus. Videos showed government opponents pouring into the streets, ripping down posters of Assad and chanting for freedom in scenes reminiscent of the early days of Syria’s uprising.\n\nThe rebel advances on Saturday added to stunning gains over the past week. The HTS-led offensive has seized Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, and Hama, its fourth-largest. Homs, capital of Syria’s largest governorate, is strategically important; it lies at the crossroads of the north-south highway that connects Aleppo and Damascus and the east-west highway that connects the desert and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who defected more than a decade ago, said the end is near. The only question now, he said, is whether Assad will agree to step aside peacefully, perhaps under a deal that offers him safe passage out of the country, or attempt to stand and fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with government forces crumbling across multiple fronts, it was unclear how much of a fight his loyalists could put up. Government forces in Damascus suffer from the same problems as troops elsewhere, including a lack of weaponry, undernourishment and, evidently, Barabandi said, poor morale.\n\nAssad’s allies Russia and Iran, to whom he owes his survival for the past decade, are distracted by conflicts elsewhere and have offered no meaningful support, giving the rebels an opening. Russia, which has backed Assad with airstrikes since 2015, is now bogged down in its war in Ukraine. Iran has been shaken by its growing conflict with Israel, which has stepped up attacks against the Islamic republic and its proxies, including Hezbollah. Hezbollah, a Shiite group based in Lebanon, has forces in Syria supporting Assad.\n\nIran began withdrawing military commanders from Syria on Friday, according to an Iraqi official and a regional diplomat. It’s also evacuating nonessential diplomatic staff from Damascus, according to the Iraqi official, who said “they feared they would be trapped after the collapse.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, a former intelligence chief in Lebanon, said Iranian movements suggest Tehran believes Assad will be unable to hold back the rebel advances.\n\n“For the Iranians, to choose between their country and Hezbollah, certainly they chose their safety over Hezbollah,” he said.\n\nRussia has also urged its citizens to leave the country. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, when asked on Saturday whether Moscow believes the Syrian president can hang on to power, told Al Jazeera he was “not in the business of guessing.”\n\nEven regime supporters appeared resigned to the apparent inevitability of his ouster. “We supported him because he represented the only secular option presented to us. It was not about him,” said a staunchly pro-regime businessman who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety. But now, he said, “people are ready to accept a newer, more advanced and more free secular state.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssad has vanished from public view since appearing with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi last Sunday in Damascus and has made no statements. Expectations among regime supporters that he would address the nation on Saturday evening went unfulfilled.\n\nSyrian state media denied rumors that he had fled to Moscow, Tehran or the United Arab Emirates. People with connections to his inner circle said he was almost certainly still in Damascus. But since announcing a 50 percent pay raise this week for the army, he has taken no discernible action to rally his followers.\n\nEarlier Saturday, regime forces appeared to be ceding territory with little fight to focus on Damascus, its surroundings, Homs and the coast, said Haid Haid, a research fellow at London-based Chatham House.\n\n“The regime has given up on all nonstrategic areas,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut soon the regime’s strategic strongholds were also teetering. Capturing Homs would enable the rebels to pressure the capital from the north and the south. A rebel victory in Homs would cleave Asaad’s territory in two, splitting the capital from regime strongholds on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIraqi government spokesman Bassim Al-Awadi told the news network Rudaw that 2,000 Syrian soldiers were now in Iraq. Two senior Iraqi army officers estimated their number to be the equivalent of three military divisions. A third official put the number at 1,500. The government in Baghdad gave the Syrian troops permission to enter through the Al-Qaim border crossing.\n\nJolani, the HTS leader, was formerly affiliated with al-Qaeda but has broken ties and is attempting to present himself as the face of a unified, more moderate opposition. In a bid to reassure panicked residents and foreign aid groups, HTS said all government and international institutions, including the United Nations, were “serving the people, and it is our duty to protect and preserve them.”\n\nIt’s not surprising that the regime has pulled back from the south, where it has battled a sporadic insurgency for years, said Gregory Waters, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute who studies Syrian forces. But its shaky hold on areas around Damascus points to an army in a state of collapse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the idea is to reinforce Damascus, this is meant to be the fortress,” he said. But local groups, he said, appear to have overrun neighborhoods in the suburbs with little effort.\n\nZeina Shahla, a 42-year-old Damascus woman, said stores were running out of goods.\n\n“We’re watching the news and don’t know what to do,” she said. “People are scared. People are tired. They cannot bare another war. They don’t want to see more violence and blood.”\n\nIn Jaramana, less than 10 miles from the presidential palace, men used ax-like weapons to hack and topple a giant bust of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar’s father, video verified by The Post shows. When the massive head fell, gunfire and celebratory cheers erupted.\n\n“It’s just a matter of time now,” Waters said.\n\nIt was unclear whether rebel groups in the south or opposition factions around Damascus were coordinating with HTS or had simply jumped on the opportunity to make gains against Syrian forces in disarray. “It’s not as if HTS has the puppet strings for everyone, but without their operations this wouldn’t be happening,” said Waters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Southern Operations Room, a newly announced faction, said it had taken control of Daraa governorate. Videos posted online showed a statue of Hafez al-Assad being toppled in Daraa city. “Different groups are racing to capture as many areas as possible,” Haid said.\n\nThe Syrian state news agency SANA said that “the sounds heard in some areas of the southern Damascus countryside are of long-range targeting and shooting at terrorist gatherings in Daraa.”\n\nSweida, inhabited by members of the Druze religious minority, was under the control of Druze factions Saturday morning after the army withdrew, according to a local activist who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for security.\n\n“The governor’s house is empty, the governor is heading to Damascus, the province is empty, the police chief’s office is empty, everything is empty from the soldiers,” she said. The people, she said, had seen “this was their chance.”"

Sign Up For Free »\n\nIn Jan. 2023, I wrote about my 10 top stocks to buy for the new year. I ended up pretty proud of my list because if you'd invested $1,000 in each of the 10 stocks the day the article was published, you'd have ended 2023 with $13,301, including dividends. If you'd instead put your $10,000 into an S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index fund, you would've had just $11,900 at the end of the year. In other words, the total return of my stock picks beat the broad market by 74%.\n\nAnd last December, I updated my list of top 10 stocks for 2024, which have again outperformed the market. With $10,000 invested equally across those 10 stocks at the beginning of the year, you'd have $14,281 as of the Dec. 5 market close. An equal investment in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth $12,890. That's a total return difference of 48%.\n\nThat's an encouraging result given how strong stocks have been this year. When the market is down, it's much easier to beat. For example, when the S&P 500 lost 18% in 2022, 51% of U.S. equity managers underperformed the market. But through the first half of a bullish 2024, 57% of large-cap U.S. equity managers were underperforming the index, and 60% underperformed it last year when the index was up 24%.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how my picks are faring with about a month to go in 2024 and consider whether you should buy them for the coming year.\n\nDrumroll, please ...\n\nThe top 10 stocks I chose for 2024 were Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), Global-e Online (NASDAQ: GLBE), Lemonade (NYSE: LMND), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI), and Visa (NYSE: V).\n\nHere's how they are performing compared to the S&P 500 as of Dec. 5:\n\nNine of my top 10 picks are up year to date. The lone exception, Lululemon, is experiencing some major challenges right now. Let's do a quick rundown on each of these stocks and their prospects for 2025.\n\nAirbnb: Flat\n\nAfter gaining 59% in 2023, Airbnb has been flat this year. Growth has slowed, but profitability has soared. It's looking more like a value stock right now, and it's building on its popular platform. Shares trade at only 22 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, and value investors should take a look.\n\nAmazon: Up 45%\n\nAmazon has launched powerful artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that are driving tremendous growth in its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the leading global cloud services provider, and AI is bringing in new clients. It's also the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. with a wide lead. Amazon remains a top choice for almost any investor.\n\nStory Continues"

      "full_content": "It's been nothing short of a banner year for Wall Street and investors. As of the closing bell on Dec. 5, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have respectively gained 19%, 27%, and 31% year to date.\n\nWall Street's two-year bull market has been fueled by a number of catalysts. For instance, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution may provide a leap forward in growth potential for businesses. Additionally, operating results for Wall Street's most influential businesses have, for the most part, been better than anticipated.\n\nBut the latest catalyst for the stock market is arguably the most eyebrow-raising: President-elect Donald Trump's November victory.\n\nTrump's return to the White House for a nonconsecutive second term in January will very likely pave the way for less stringent banking regulations, more merger and acquisition activity, and possibly a 29% reduction in the corporate income tax rate for domestic manufacturers. The proposals laid out by the former (and incoming) president are undeniably investor-friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, history offers an ominous warning for Wall Street and the stock market as Donald Trump prepares to take office in just over six weeks.\n\nDonald Trump making remarks at the Pentagon.\n\nPresident Donald Trump giving remarks at the Pentagon. Image source: Official White House Photo by Tia Dufour.\n\nRepublican presidents and recessions go hand in hand\n\nLet me preface the following discussion with an important caveat: There is no such thing as a guaranteed forecasting tool on Wall Street. Although some events, metrics, and predictive data points have an uncanny history of accuracy, there's no concrete guarantee of anything occurring in the stock market.\n\nWith that said, history shows an exceptionally strong correlation between Republican presidents in the White House and U.S. recessions.\n\nOver the last 111 years, there have been 10 Republicans in the Oval Office and nine Democrats. Four of the nine Democrats to hold America's highest office did not oversee a recession that began under their tenure (key phrase!). This figure makes the logical assumption that President Joe Biden won't see a recession declared during his final six weeks in office, which would make him the fourth Democratic president to avoid a recession.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Republican presidents have overseen 13 recessions since 1913, with every single GOP chief contending with a recession during their tenure. Donald Trump was the latest addition to this lengthy list due to the COVID-19 pandemic-driven recession.\n\nWhile nothing is guaranteed, every Republican president for more than a century overseeing a recession is a worrisome correlation for Wall Street. Even though stocks and the U.S. economy aren't tethered at the hip, economic contractions would be expected to adversely impact corporate earnings.\n\nWhat's more, a study from Bank of America Global Research found that, between 1927 and March 2023, two-thirds of peak-to-trough drawdowns in the S&P 500 occurred during, not prior to, recessions being declared. In plainer English, stocks perform poorly when recessions occur.\n\nOminous warnings are mounting for the U.S. economy and stock market\n\nAs Donald Trump readies to take office for his second term, he's going to inherit a challenging set of circumstances. While the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all galloped to multiple record-closing highs in the wake of Election Day, ominous warnings for the U.S. economy and Wall Street are beginning to mount.\n\nUS M2 Money Supply Chart\n\nUS M2 Money Supply data by YCharts.\n\nFor example, in 2023, U.S. M2 money supply endured its biggest year-over-year decline since the Great Depression.\n\nThere have been only four periods prior to last year when M2 money supply fell by at least 2% on a year-over-year basis -- 1878, 1893, 1921, and 1931-1933 -- and they all correlate with periods of economic depression and double-digit unemployment. Though a depression is highly unlikely in modern times, thanks to the tools the Federal Reserve and federal government have at their disposal, a notable drop in M2 does suggest that consumers may make fewer discretionary purchases, which is an ingredient for a recession.\n\nAnother source of concern is the longest yield-curve inversion on record between the three-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury bond.\n\nNormally, the yield curve slopes up and to the right, with yields increasing the longer your money is tied up in an interest-bearing asset. But when investors are worried about the economic outlook, the yield curve can invert, with short-term T-bills sporting higher yields than T-bonds. Although an inverted yield curve doesn't guarantee a recession will occur, every recession since World War II has been preceded by one.\n\nWe're also witnessing clear-cut red flags from historically flawless valuation measures.\n\nS&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nS&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nThe S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, also referred to as the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE ratio), ended Dec. 5 at 38.81, well above its average reading of 17.17 when back-tested to January 1871. It also marks the third-highest reading during a continuous bull market.\n\nMore importantly, the five previous instances spanning 153 years where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E topped 30 were eventually followed by declines of 20% to 89% in the S&P 500 and/or Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe famed \"Buffett Indicator\" is pushing boundaries, too. The valuation tool Warren Buffett praised earlier this century, which divides the market value of all public companies into U.S. gross domestic product, hit a record high of 208% last week. For context, it's averaged closer to 85% since 1970.\n\nMost signs point to economic and stock market turbulence taking shape at some point during President-elect Trump's second term.\n\nA professional investor using a stylus to interact with a rapidly rising stock chart displayed on a tablet.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHistory also shows that patience consistently prevails\n\nBut there is a silver lining amid these short-term warnings. Specifically, history is a two-sided coin, and it tends to favor patient investors far more than short-term traders.\n\nEven though Republican presidents and recessions have gone hand-in-hand for more than 110 years, an even stronger historic correlation is the nonlinearity of the economic cycle.\n\nSince World War II came to a conclusion in September 1945, the U.S. has worked its way through a dozen recessions. Of these 12 downturns, nine were resolved in less than a year, while none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months in length. While recessions can undoubtedly be worrisome and lead to emotion-driven moves in the stock market, they're historically short-lived.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, over the last 79 years, there have been two periods of growth that surpassed the 10-year mark. A majority of economic expansions are going to stick around for multiple years, which is why the U.S. economy and corporate earnings grow over long periods.\n\nIt's a similar story for the stock market.\n\nEvery year, the analysts at Crestmont Research update a data set that examines the rolling 20-year total returns (including dividends) of the broad-based S&P 500 since 1900. Though the S&P didn't come into existence until 1923, researchers were able to trace its components to other indexes prior to its inception -- thus, the total returns data are back-tested to 1900.\n\nWhat Crestmont Research found was that all 105 rolling 20-year periods, with end dates ranging from 1919 through 2023, produced a positive total return. In other words, if an investor had, hypothetically, purchased an S&P 500 tracking index at any point since 1900 and held that position for 20 years, they would have generated a profit every single time, regardless of which party controlled the White House during that timeline.\n\nEven if history rhymes, once more, during Donald Trump's second term, patient investors are well positioned for success.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

But Sharma pointed to other metrics that indicate how out of whack markets have become, even after factoring out the AI boom that has sent a handful of U.S. tech stocks to stratospheric levels.\n\nIndices that weight stocks by price instead of market cap and adjust for the leading tech giants show that the U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world by more than 4-to-1 since 2009, he explained.\n\nAnd such outperformance isn't restricted to stocks either. In 2024 alone, $1 trillion in foreign capital has poured into U.S. debt markets, nearly double what the eurozone has attracted. And America controls more than 70% of the global market for private equity and credit.\n\n\"In the past, including the roaring 1920s and the dotcom era, a rising US market would lift other markets,\" Sharma wrote. \"Today, a booming US market is sucking money out of the others.\"\n\nA mania in market sentiment can impact the real economy, he warned. For instance, investors abandoning smaller markets can weaken currencies and force central banks to hike rates—slowing those economies and worsening their fundamentals.\n\n\"Talk of bubbles in tech or AI, or in investment strategies focused on growth and momentum, obscures the mother of all bubbles in US markets,\" Sharma added. \"Thoroughly dominating the mind space of global investors, America is over-owned, overvalued and overhyped to a degree never seen before.\"\n\nHis admonition echoes what Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian said last month, when he told Bloomberg TV to expect a \"huge sucking sound\" of foreign capital flooding into the U.S.\n\nThe rest of the world may have more trouble coping with a period of faster growth and hotter inflation, adding to America’s relative edge, he predicted.\n\nStory Continues"

History suggests the rally will likely continue into 2025.\n\nThe current bull market began on Oct. 12, 2022, and while every rally is different, history can provide important context. Bull markets last more than five years, on average. Since the current rally just entered its third year, there's a strong likelihood the Nasdaq will continue to gain ground next year.

As a result, investors are taking a renewed interest in companies that split their shares, as this is historically preceded by years of robust sales and profit growth. One such company is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has gained 26,920% over the past decade (as of this writing), prompting management to initiate a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year -- after a 4-for-1 split in 2021.\n\nDespite its recent run-up, there's reason to believe that Nvidia's growth spurt will continue into 2025. Read on to find out why.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nUnderpinning the AI revolution\n\nThe adoption of generative AI has spread like wildfire over the past two years as businesses are eager to share in the productivity increases promised by these advanced algorithms. Generative AI has proven adept at drafting and summarizing emails, searching and abbreviating content, mining data, generating original content, and writing computer code -- and new applications are being discovered every day. Automating and streamlining tasks saves users time and money, driving new users to adopt AI.\n\nNvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make this all possible. These specialized chips provide the sheer number-crunching capability that brought AI to life. The secret lies in parallel processing or breaking up computer-intensive jobs into smaller, more manageable bits. Nvidia first developed these chips to render lifelike images in video games but soon discovered other applications for this breakthrough technology, including data centers, high-performance computing (HPC), and machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI.\n\nStory Continues"

The ongoing rally has a great many stocks at or near new record highs, leaving some investors to wonder whether there's still upside ahead.\n\nThose concerns are unfounded, according to Wall Street, which remains remarkably bullish. As we close out the year, forecasts for 2025 continue to ratchet higher. While these targets are focused on the broader S&P 500, they can be instructive.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop?

Sign Up For Free »\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs predict the S&P 500 will hit 6,500 in December 2025, representing gains of roughly 7% compared to Thursday's closing price. Not to be outdone, Bank of America issued a year-end price target of 6,666 for 2025, or upside of 10% from its current level. Just this week, Wells Fargo issued the most bullish forecast yet, calling for the benchmark index to hit 7,007 next year, representing potential gains of about 15%.\n\nDespite the recent run-up, opportunities abound. Let's take a look at two Nasdaq stocks with additional upside of up to 115%, according to certain Wall Street analysts.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 59%\n\nThe first Nasdaq stock with significant potential upside is Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI). The company dominates satellite radio services in North America, with 34 million paying subscribers. Its customer base jumps to 150 million when you include its ad-supported Pandora music streaming service, so its audience is unmatched.\n\nHowever, the recent economic downturn and a complicated merger took a toll. Decades-high inflation forced cash-strapped consumers to make difficult choices with their limited disposable income. Some, understandably, chose to let their SiriusXM subscription lapse.\n\nThere was also a fundamental misunderstanding of its recent merger, the reverse stock split, and the resulting complicated accounting transactions, which weighed on its results. These combined to drag the stock down 51% so far this year -- but things aren't as bad as they might seem at first glance.\n\nIn the third quarter, Sirius' revenue slipped 4% year over year to $2.17 billion while reporting a loss per share of $8.74, compared to diluted EPS of $0.82 in the prior year quarter -- but that needs context. The company took a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $3.36 billion to goodwill related to its acquisition of Liberty Sirius XM tracking stock. Had it not been for that one-time charge, Sirius would have delivered EPS of roughly $1.17, an increase of 43%.\n\nStory Continues"

Firstly, his policies concerning taxation and government regulation imply a more risk-on environment, encouraging investments and M&A activity. This is conducive for rerating of the smaller biotech names,” Peramunetilleke explained.\n\nFollowing his lead, Jefferies stock analysts have picked two small biotech stocks with strong upside – including one with a potential gain of nearly 1,000%.\n\nIn fact, Jefferies analysts are not the only ones singing the praises of these stocks. According to the TipRanks database, they are both rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s dive into what makes these stocks such compelling investment opportunities right now.\n\nMetagenomi (MGX)\n\nThe first Jefferies pick we’re looking at is Metagenomi, a biotech innovator unlocking the potential of gene editing through the power of metagenomics. This approach focuses on identifying microbial genetic systems shaped by nature and adapting their enzymes into precise tools for addressing various diseases. By leveraging the vast genetic diversity found in nature, Metagenomi aims to develop therapeutic solutions that could contribute to meaningful advancements in modern medicine.\n\nThe company’s flagship candidate, MGX-001, is a novel therapeutic agent targeting hemophilia A (hemA). Last quarter, Metagenomi announced an important achievement, reaching durable Factor VIII activity levels over a one-year period in an NHP (non-human primate) study. The company has gone on to initiate IND-enabling activities for MGX-001 as a regulatory step toward moving the program to the human clinical trial stage.\n\nBut Metagenomi isn’t stopping there. Through a partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, the company is integrating RNA-targeted therapeutics with its gene-editing systems. This collaboration focuses on cardiometabolic development programs, initially targeting four conditions, including transthyretin amyloidosis (TTR) and refractory hypertension (AGT). Currently in the lead optimization phase, these programs have demonstrated proof-of-concept in rodent models. Looking ahead, Metagenomi plans to nominate one to two development candidates by 2025.\n\nStory Continues"

Let's dig deeper to decide if Rigetti is a potential millionaire maker.\n\nWhat is a quantum computer?\n\nQuantum computers are computers that use quantum mechanics to solve problems much faster than their traditional alternatives. While the industry is still largely in the research and development stage, analysts at McKinsey estimate that it could add $1.3 trillion in value to the economy by 2035. Most of the growth is expected to come from applications like pharmaceutical development and materials science.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop?

Like the legendary chipmaker, Rigetti serves the infrastructure side of this opportunity, building quantum computers and their key hardware components like processors. The company has also developed its Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform designed to give clients access to its quantum processors remotely through the cloud.\n\nRigetti has designed QCS to integrate with traditional computer hardware, making it easier for customers to access the technology. Naturally, this could represent huge cost savings for a client compared to building its own quantum computing capabilities in-house.\n\nOperations are still at an early stage\n\nBy going public through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Rigetti was able to list at a particularly early stage in its operations. Third-quarter revenue fell 23% year over year to $2.4 million. And while the company generated a gross profit of $1.2 million, it posted an operating loss of $17.3 million after accounting for important outflows like research, development, and office salaries.\n\nIt gets worse. Rigetti has spent a whopping $9.7 million on stock-based compensation this year. While this technique can save cash and motivate employees, it dilutes shareholders by increasing the number of shares outstanding and lowering their claims on future earnings or cash flow.\n\nStory Continues"

It'll inflect at some point in 2025.”\n\nRecent data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reveals the industry has been in contraction for the past eight consecutive months and 24 of the past 25 months.\n\nThe prolonged slump has weighed on the sector's stocks.\n\nSince the start of the year, the industry’s largest companies have posted mixed performance, with stocks like GE Aerospace (GE) and Eaton Corporation (ETN) among the top performers, while UPS (UPS) and Union Pacific (UNP) have declined year to date.\n\nThe cautious optimism stems from several factors, including President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. Trump’s economic policies include strategies widely supported by the business community, such as deregulation, infrastructure investment, and tax cuts.\n\nHEICO co-president Eric Mendelson told me he sees Trump’s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a “very positive environment” for the industrial sector.\n\nIndustry executives are also largely encouraged about Elon Musk’s influence on the incoming administration. Robert Cardillo, chairman of the board at Planet Federal and chief strategist of Planet Labs, told me at the conference that Musk’s impact will likely be “good news” for the sector.\n\nPlanet Labs (PL) shares, along with the broader space industry, have soared since Election Day. The stock is up nearly 80% in the past month as investors bet the incoming administration will be supportive of the sector.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Ritchie makes the case that companies that have streamlined operations and refocused their portfolios are best positioned for growth. His top pick in the sector is Parker-Hannifin (PH), citing the company’s decade-long transformation initiative.\n\n• USD (PH) View Quote Details\n\n“It’s a great company and very well run … About two-thirds of the business is tied to industrial activity, and about one-third of the business is tied to aerospace and defense. They've been able to perform incredibly well even at a time when the industrial markets haven't been a tailwind for them,” Richie said.\n\nHe also said well-known names like Honeywell (HON) and 3M (MMM) are taking the right steps to become more focused and “transform the margins on the business.”"

Sign Up For Free »\n\nAccenture's army of AI experts\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said during its conference call that Accenture created a new unit with 30,000 employees trained on Nvidia's AI technology. This makes it one of the most well-equipped companies to provide clients with the AI expertise they may lack in-house. While tech giants like Alphabet or Microsoft have huge teams devoted to this technology, companies in the banking, industrial, or oil sectors, for example, are unlikely to have those sorts of internal resources. As a result, they need to work with consulting firms like Accenture.\n\nAccenture CEO Julie Sweet had this to say about generative AI:\n\nIn every industry, there is a challenge or opportunity that GenAI can now uniquely solve. Our deep understanding of both the industry and the technology positions us to be the best at creating real value from GenAI with our clients.\n\nThat perfectly sums up the AI-related investment thesis for Accenture, as it is set to benefit from generative AI going mainstream in the coming years. Still, it is a huge consulting firm with many areas of specialization and expertise. It isn't an AI pure-play.\n\nBut does the rest of the business plus an AI boost equal a winning investment?\n\nA pricey stock based on the outlook\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 31, Accenture saw new bookings of $20.1 billion, of which generative AI made up $1 billion. So while generative AI has clearly given the business a boost, it only accounted for 5% of total bookings, making it a relatively minor part of the larger investment picture.\n\nFiscal 2024 wasn't the greatest year for Accenture, as clients were conservative with their spending. Revenue rose just 3% in Q4 and only 1% for the year. The outlook for fiscal 2025 is slightly better -- management expects revenue to grow by 3% to 6% in local currencies. (As a global business headquartered in Ireland, it's exposed to changes in currency exchange rates.) Still, considering that many AI companies are boosting their revenue at much faster rates than that, is Accenture worth investing in?\n\nStory Continues"

So investors might be surprised to learn that this top stock, which seems to have rebounded, is still 63% off its all-time highs.\n\nThe business itself is doing great, with sales completed back and growing, and demand at unprecedented levels. In the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended Aug. 31), revenue increased from $6.9 billion to $7.9 billion year over year. Nearly half of 2025 inventory was already booked as of the end of September, and it's also in its best-ever booked position for 2026.\n\nProfitability still isn't where it used to be, which was reliable and growing. Today, it's still returning. But as demand stays strong, the profitability metrics are healthy. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 25% over last year to $2.8 billion in the third quarter, and operating income improved by $554 million from last year to $2.2 billion. Net income was positive in the quarter at $1.7 billion, although Carnival hasn't returned to consistently positive net income -- yet.\n\nSo what's the problem? The main issue for investors is Carnival's massive debt, which it took on when cruises weren't running. Although management is paying it off steadily, it's still highly elevated at $29 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Carnival stock soared on the news of interest rates being cut, because that will help it pay off the debt faster.\n\nAnother worry is that demand will eventually slow down, and Carnival's performance could look choppy before it stabilizes to normal levels. But investors should focus on the long term.\n\nStory Continues"

Despite its troubles in recent years, the aviation giant remains in an effective duopoly in the commercial aerospace jet market with Airbus. It also has a $500 million backlog, representing more than seven years of its expected sales in 2024. The ingredients for a recovery are in place, and so is a new chief executive officer, Kelly Ortberg, appointed in the summer to lead a turnaround at the company. Is it enough to make Boeing a compelling stock for long-term investors?\n\nBoeing's recovery\n\nThe stock certainly has upside potential, and as previously discussed, it doesn't rely only on ramping up 737 MAX production and working through problematic fixed-price development programs in its defense business. Those are critical elements of a recovery and are within Boeing's reach, too.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop? Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free »\n\nHowever, the new CEO could restore a lot of faith among investors in other ways, such as by resetting investor expectations to more realistic targets than $10 billion in free cash flow for 2025/2026, a goal set by Ortberg's predecessor, Dave Calhoun. Similarly, Ortberg is on record saying Boeing's defense business needs to improve its estimate-at-completion (EAC) processes -- if a company can't get its internal EAC right, it's highly likely to disappoint investors with its external forecasts. In addition, Ortberg is taking the opportunity to review the portfolio, and the possibility of restructuring the company could generate value for investors.\n\nPutting it all together, it's clear that much of what Boeing needs to do is attainable, and management has multiple ways to add value for investors. There's always the cyclical risk of an economic slowdown and its impact on airplane orders, but Boeing is essentially a self-help story.\n\nImage source: Boeing.\n\nRisk and reward for Boeing\n\nThe company has upside potential, but is it an investment that can set you up for life? Frankly, that looks unlikely, for two reasons:\n\nBoeing faces many obstacles on its way to recovery.\n\nA long-term investor must consider that the stock's valuation reflects the necessity of investing in the next cycle of airplanes\n\nThe risks and headwinds are significant. Persistent supply chain difficulties in the aerospace sector are creating challenges for aircraft manufacturers and suppliers alike, and those headwinds will make it difficult and expensive to boost production. For example, consider that GE Aerospace started the year expecting to deliver 20%-25% more LEAP engines (used to power the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo family) in 2024 than in 2023. Fast-forward to the third quarter, and its management predicts 10% less than 2023. Meanwhile, another supplier, fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems (a company Boeing spun-off and now plans to buy back), is burning cash and has warned investors it might not be able to continue as a going concern.\n\nStory Continues"

Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) was the highest-yielding Dow stock in January. The pharmacy and convenience store conglomerate has fallen 66% since then and has lost its seat at the Dow Industrials table.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Dow has recently become less dividend-focused. The list of index components didn't change from August 2020 to February 2024, but three new names joined the list in the last 10 months. The highest dividend yield in the group of newcomers is 0.7% for paint store giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW). The softest dividend from the now-former Dow members was Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) 1.5% yield -- now entirely paused.\n\nUsing the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEMKT: DIA) as a proxy for the Dow, the index's dividend yield fell from 1.8% to 1.4% year to date.\n\nThese recent trends look unfavorable for the Dogs of the Dow strategy. Can the top three yielders on today's list turn the tables in 2025?\n\nVerizon is all about the dividend\n\nVerizon always pays generous dividends, as do most of the leading names in large-scale telecommunications. With modest revenue growth, massive hardware installation and maintenance costs, and $150 billion of long-term debt, it's no surprise to see Verizon share lots of surplus cash profits with its shareholders. Beefy dividends quickly become the main investor attraction as telecom giants mature.\n\nThe lion's share of Verizon's recent returns were indeed generated by the dividend payouts.

Sorry, not sorry, Tim Cook!\n\nWho deserves the credit? The top brass at each company that have been focused on running more beastly telecom operations. I am talking about a maniacal focus on profit margins, free cash flow generation, and expansion of potentially lucrative opportunities. And in turn, there has been zero focus on doing dumb things with shareholder money like expanding into the media business.\n\nFirst up in this analytical drill-down is Dallas, Texas-based AT&T, led by company veteran John Stankey.\n\nAt an investor day this week, Stankey used his trademark deep voice (see video above) to outline more than $40 billion to be returned to shareholders over the next three years via stock buybacks and dividends. What really caught my attention was the guidance for double-digit percentage earnings growth in 2027.\n\nAT&T and double-digit earnings growth normally aren't heard in the same sentence.\n\nExecs are betting that investments in 5G infrastructure and fiber will yield a quicker pace of sales and earnings growth than seen in 2024.\n\nFor Stankey, the year-end investor day capped his continued efforts to pivot back to simply being a telecom giant.\n\nIn April 2022, AT&T closed its deal to spin off its WarnerMedia division, which it had purchased for a colossal $85 billion just three years earlier. The move combined WarnerMedia's HBO and CNN with Discovery's HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC.\n\nThe deal has been a full-on disaster for CEO David Zaslav who leads the now Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).\n\nSince the spin-off, AT&T has zeroed in on reducing debt, partly from the WarnerMedia acquisition. In September, AT&T sold its majority stake in TV provider DirecTV to private equity firm TPG for $7.6 billion.\n\nAT&T's long-term debt now stands at $126 billion, down from more than $128 billion in 2022.\n\n\"I can say that we are back in growth mode,\" Stankey told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. \"I think we're early innings in our success story, so I don't think it's mission accomplished.\"\n\nStankey added he's bullish on the Trump administration providing tailwinds to his business, especially if tax cuts are extended."

Not only is the AI business itself already producing billions of dollars in revenue, but the AWS platform is attracting new clients who want to use Amazon's AI services. CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized his view that this is just the beginning, noting that 90% of global IT spending still goes toward on-premises systems, while 10% goes to the cloud. He expects those proportions to flip over the long haul.

Demand from AI customers was soaring, and catalysts such as the launch of Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture promised to help this momentum continue. Supermicro incorporates chip designers' innovations into its systems, so their new releases translate into growth for the equipment maker.\n\nAnother victory for Supermicro: The S&P 500 invited the stock to join, showing that Supermicro had become one of the major companies powering today's economy. Finally, Supermicro shares climbed so high -- beyond $1,000 earlier this year -- that the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split, with the new split-adjusted shares to start trading as of Oct. 1. By lowering the per-share price through the issuance of new shares to current holders, stock splits open up the investment opportunity to a broader range of investors.\n\nThen came the difficult period, launched by a Hindenburg Research short report alleging \"glaring accounting red flags\" and other problems. Supermicro called the statements \"false or inaccurate.\" But the shares continued to decline as the company delayed its annual report and a quarterly report and its auditor quit.

AT&T hurt its reputation with many of these investors when it lowered its dividend in 2022 amidst the spinoff of Warner Brothers, which merged with Discovery to become Warner Bro Discovery (WBD). However, the move to spin off Warner Brothers looks like the right decision in hindsight, as the stock has languished amidst a series of struggles.\n\nMeanwhile, AT&T is quietly getting back in the good graces of dividend investors. The stock yields an attractive 4.9%, well above the market average and above that of treasury bonds at a time when interest rates are likely to continue decreasing. Plus, after the 2022 cut, AT&T’s dividend looks safe and secure, with a dividend coverage ratio of just under 50%. This week, AT&T outlined its multi-year strategic vision at its Analyst & Investor Day, laying out plans to return $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years.\n\nThis will be done through a combination of $20 billion in dividend payments and $20 billion worth of share buybacks. This includes an initial share buyback authorization to purchase back $10 billion worth of shares before the end of 2026. Share buybacks are accretive to investors as they reduce the number of shares outstanding (thus increasing earnings per share) and can be a signal that management views shares as undervalued. Buybacks can be especially accretive for stocks that pay a large dividend because each share bought back is a share they no longer have to pay out the dividend on.\n\nStreamlined Business\n\nAT&T’s Investor Day re-established the fact that AT&T is prioritizing returns to shareholders, and it was also a good reminder that this is a more streamlined business than it was just a few years ago. The moves to foray into the entertainment business by purchasing DirectTV in 2015 and Time Warner in 2018 can only be described as major missteps.\n\nStory Continues"

If you dive in too early, you may learn the hard way that the potential miracle drug in development is actually a bust. If you wait too long, you could miss out on the bulk of a stock's gains.\n\nWith that in mind, risk-tolerant investors should look at Iovance Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ: IOVA) while shares are still down more than 80% from their early 2021 peak.\n\nSuch pullbacks aren't particularly unusual for the biopharma industry's younger names. Iovance soared when its flagship drug first started showing promise in clinical trials back in 2019 and 2020. Investors got a bit ahead of themselves though. The first regulatory approval of its cancer-fighting Amtagvi didn't materialize until February of this year. While the market rewarded the company for that accomplishment with a bounce in the share price, most of the bullish euphoria had already worn off by then. And most of the gains the stock booked earlier this year have since evaporated.\n\nBut you can use the stock's current weakness to your advantage.\n\nWhile Amtagvi's FDA-approved uses may be relatively narrow in scope right now -- it is approved only for the treatment of certain types of solid tumors -- this T-cell therapy is a potential treatment for a much wider range of cancers. The drug is being tested in 12 other clinical trials at this time, and a handful of them are promising late-stage trials.\n\nBut even without any future approvals, Iovance is already doing pretty well with Amtagvi. Last quarter's $58.6 million in revenue was a marked improvement on what was effectively inaugural revenue of $31.1 million in Q2, putting the company en route to a full-year top line of roughly $160 million. Sales next year are expected to rise to between $450 million and $475 million. That's just the beginning though. The analyst community is predicting revenue of more than $700 million in 2026, while research outfit GlobalData believes annual sales of Amtagvi could eclipse $1 billion by 2030.\n\nStory Continues"

Let's take a look at where each stands.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nOn paper, an 11.8% dividend yield seems like an income investor's dream. However, when you look at why Walgreens Boots Alliance's yield is that high, you'll see where the problem lies -- especially considering the company cut its quarterly payouts by 48% to $0.25 early this year.\n\nThrough Dec. 6, the stock price of Walgreens Boots Alliance has dropped by more than 68% in 2024.\n\nThere hasn't been much encouraging news coming from the company lately. Its operating loss in its fiscal 2024 was $14.1 billion, it plans to close around 1,200 stores in the next couple of years, and competition from the likes of Amazon and Walmart is steadily increasing. Needless to say, none of those facts are sparking optimism among investors.\n\nThe investment thesis gets even worse when you consider the appeal of the stock has been its dividend, and even that seems to be in jeopardy. Walgreens Boots Alliance distributed $1.3 billion in dividends in fiscal 2024 while being leagues away from making a profit. That's a recipe for another dividend cut to be on the horizon.\n\nWhether Walgreens Boots Alliance will dial back its dividend again or even suspend it entirely remains to be seen, but it's not a stock I'd feel comfortable investing in heading into 2025.\n\n2. Altria Group\n\nTobacco giant Altria has routinely been one of the S&P 500's highest-yielding dividend stocks. The stock is up by close to 37% this year (as of Dec. 6), which makes its yield of around 7% -- more than five times the S&P 500's average -- even more impressive.\n\nStory Continues"

      "full_content": "Buying the right stock at the right time can transform your life. For example, if you had invested $10,000 in electric vehicle (EV) industry leader Tesla in 2014, you would have a whopping $245,300 today. That's a return of over 2,430% in just a decade. Could Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) be the next best thing? Let's explore the pros and cons of this EV start-up to decide if it has multi-bagger potential over the long term.\n\nThe hype has faded\n\nRivian was at the top of the world when its shares became available through an initial public offering (IPO) in 2021. This was a different time for the EV industry. Tesla had recently become profitable, proving the technology was here to stay. And Rivian's lineup of high-end trucks and EVs promised to fill an overlooked opportunity in the market.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\n\nWith a starting market capitalization of over $100 billion, the company immediately became America's second-most-valuable automaker behind Tesla -- leaving traditional marques like Ford Motor Company and General Motors in the dust. In hindsight, this made very little sense. And the market quickly soured on Rivian as growth stalled and rivals began offering products like the F-150 lighting, Silverado EV, and Cybertruck, which took over its niche.\n\nBusiness growth is stalling\n\nRivian's third-quarter revenue fell 18% year over year to $874 million on a decline in both production and deliveries. To be fair, the EV industry is much more competitive now than it was when Rivian went public. And macroeconomic challenges like inflation and high interest rates probably aren't helping consumer appetite for its high-end cars.\n\nBut it's hard to make any excuses for Rivian when rival products like the Tesla Cybertruck are doing so well. According to Kelley Blue Book, Elon Musk's polarizing vehicle has sold a whopping 28,240 units so far this year, trouncing Rivian's R1T, which has only sold 10,387 units. This is despite the Cybertruck's higher sticker price, with a base price of $82,235, compared to Rivian's R1T, which starts at $71,700.\n\nWorse still, Rivian lost an average of $39,130 on every car it sold -- up from $30,448 last year. With a gross margin of negative 45%, it costs the company more to manufacture and deliver its cars than it can recoup by selling them.\n\nCEO Ryan Scaringe believes he can change the situation. He claims the company is on track to achieve gross profitability in the fourth quarter by improving revenue per unit and variable costs per unit. This will involve selling regulatory credits, improving materials costs, and unlocking manufacturing efficiencies. But this doesn't fix Rivian's core problem with heavy competition and poor top-line growth.\n\nStory Continues"

The global infrastructure operator has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate over that time frame. It currently offers investors a nearly 4% dividend yield, which is more than three times higher than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) (1.2% yield).\n\nThe company pays a well-supported dividend. It generates very stable cash flow, with 90% contracted or regulated (70% of which has no volume or price exposure) and 85% either indexed to or protected from inflation. Brookfield expects its dividend payout ratio will be around 67% of its funds from operations (FFO) this year, putting it within its 60%-70% target range. The company also has a strong investment-grade balance sheet with lots of liquidity.\n\nBrookfield's dividend is only part of the equation. The company also expects to continue growing its FFO at a more than 10% annual rate. It has several organic growth drivers, including inflation-linked rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and development projects. It currently has a record backlog of $8 billion of projects (data centers, semiconductor fabrication facilities, utility connections, and midstream expansions) and over $4 billion of additional projects in development.\n\nOn top of that, the company expects to continue completing accretive M&A transactions. Its current deal pipeline is as big as it has been in two years and continues to grow.\n\nThese drivers should enable Brookfield to grow its dividend by 5% to 9% each year.\n\nPlenty of fuel to continue growing\n\nEnbridge recently reached a notable milestone. The Canadian pipeline and utility operator has increased its dividend for 30 straight years. It currently offers an even higher dividend yield of more than 6%.\n\nThe company has one of the lowest-risk business models in the energy sector. About 98% of its earnings come from stable cost-of-service or contracted assets, while 80% have inflation protections. That enables the company to deliver very predictable earnings. It's on pace to achieve its annual financial guidance for the 19th year in a row.\n\nStory Continues"

Pfizer\n\nIf there's one thing income-seeking investors can count on, it's steadily rising demand for prescription drugs. As one of the world's largest drugmakers, Pfizer has already raised its dividend payout for 15 consecutive years. At recent prices, it offers a 6.7% yield.\n\nPfizer's share price tanked in 2023 in response to rapidly falling COVID-19 product sales. It's remained depressed because some of its largest revenue streams, such as the oral blood thinner Eliquis, could lose patent-protected exclusivity over the next few years.\n\nUpcoming patent cliffs will pressure the growth rate of Pfizer's dividend payout in the coming decade. With plenty of new revenue streams coming online, though, they probably won't stop the company from raising its payout for another 15 years.\n\nPfizer made a lot of investments with its COVID-19 vaccine windfall, and many are succeeding. In the first nine months of 2024, sales of its COVID-19 vaccine plummeted by 66% to $2.0 billion. Despite the loss, total revenue climbed by 3% year over year.\n\nThe FDA approved nine new drugs from Pfizer's productive development pipeline in 2023. In the U.S., where those new drugs are already driving growth, product sales soared 27% year over year during the first nine months of 2024.\n\n2. PennantPark Floating Rate Capital\n\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital is a business development company (BDC), which means it lends to mid-sized businesses. American banks have been less inclined to lend directly to businesses for decades.\n\nMid-sized businesses starved for capital borrow at rates you might find surprising. The average yield on debt investments in this BDC's portfolio was 11.5% at the end of September.\n\nStory Continues"

Amazon\n\nInvesting in familiar brands is often a smart move. If you're one of the millions of Prime members that regularly shops on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), you already understand why it's a great business. It has used its extensive selection, competitive prices, and fast shipping to capture its share of the $6 trillion global e-commerce market, which has translated to wealth-building returns for shareholders over the last 20 years. The size of that opportunity suggests Amazon can grow for a long time.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.

The shares have more than doubled over the last five years and continue to hit new highs as the company improves its profitability and scales its cloud-services business. In the third quarter, Amazon said its net sales grew 11% over the year-ago quarter, while lower costs helped drive a 55% increase in net income.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's cloud-services business continues to win new business from organizations migrating their data systems from on-premise servers to the cloud. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers customers everything they need to take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which is helping businesses optimize processes and innovate faster for their customers. AI is a big reason AWS has reported accelerating revenue growth this year and should continue to be a key driver of the stock's returns, since AWS generates most of Amazon's profit.\n\nAmazon stock can deliver double-digit annualized returns for several more years. It is still chasing a growing e-commerce market, while the public cloud market is expected to reach a value of $1.8 trillion by 2029, according to Statista.\n\n2. Roku\n\nRoku (NASDAQ: ROKU) is another familiar name for the more than 85 million households that use the streaming platform. The stock was expensive going into a brutal year for the ad market in 2022, which led to weak financial results for Roku's ad-driven connected TV platform. But those headwinds are behind it, and with the stock trading at a discounted valuation, investors can buy shares at prices that may undervalue its long-term growth opportunity.\n\nStory Continues"

That gain turned $1,000 into more than $2.2 million today.\n\nThe company started out disrupting the retail sector, leading to its current leading position in the e-commerce niche. Nearly 38% of all spending online in the U.S. happens on Amazon.com, indicative of the business's dominance.\n\nHowever, Amazon benefits from other powerful secular trends. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, has a leading market share, raking in trailing-12-month revenue of $103 billion. The company also has a popular streaming service in Prime Video, and a large presence in digital advertising.\n\nAmazon is winning over investors by focusing more on the bottom line. During the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, it generated $17.4 billion in operating income, which was up 55% year over year. The leadership team has focused relentlessly on cost cuts and operational efficiency. Wall Street analysts see operating income soaring at a yearly rate of 38.9% between 2023 and 2026.\n\nShares might be at all-time highs, but investors are still being presented with a nice buying opportunity. The current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.1 is reasonable, given the company's impressive earnings trajectory.\n\nApple\n\nWith a current market cap of just under $3.7 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been the world's most valuable company. This has come about thanks to a stock that has generated a 245,800% total return since December 1980, turning $1,000 into just under $2.5 million right now.\n\nApple has become a consumer electronics juggernaut by providing its users with beautifully designed hardware products that come equipped with the company's internal software capabilities.

After all, the Big Ten has long been a conference dominated by Ohio State and Michigan, and when the league dropped divisions, most were certain those would be the two programs reaching this game.\n\nInstead, it's an Oregon program navigating the Big Ten for the first time -- a program that happens to be the only undefeated FBS team remaining. Standing between the Ducks and a Big Ten title is a Penn State team that was largely written off as a Big Ten contender after losing to Ohio State earlier in the season.\n\nThe Nittany Lions have long been labeled a program unable to get over the hump. Well, Michigan got rid of that hump for them last week.\n\nWhile both teams are firmly entrenched in the CFP's 12-team field, the No. 1 seed and a bye is reachable for both. If Oregon wins, it'll remain at No. 1, and Penn State could jump to No. 1 with a win over the Ducks even if No. 2 Texas beats Georgia.\n\nIn other words, there's a whole hell of a lot to play for in Indianapolis Saturday night.\n\nFollow along with LIVE updates as Oregon and Penn State clash for the Big Ten Championship.\n\nHow to watch Oregon vs. Penn State live\n\nDate: Saturday, December 7 | Time: 8 p.m. ET\n\nLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium -- Indianapolis, IN\n\nTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free)\n\nStreaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free)\n\nOregon vs. Penn State: Need to know\n\nOregon could do something only Michigan State has done before: With a win in this game, Oregon would boast victories over Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State in the same season. All in their first year in the Big Ten! Only one other program has done that, and it's Michigan State. The funny part? Michigan State has done it five times! Most recently in 2015, but the Spartans did it in 1951, 1965, 1966 and 1999 as well. Remember, Penn State didn't join the league until 1993, so those first three times included nonconference games.\n\nOregon is one of five teams to reach the conference championship in its first season in a new league this year: It seems there's value in unfamiliarity? The new blood across the country has found plenty of success in their new homes this season. Arizona State (Big 12), Army (American), SMU (ACC) and Texas (SEC) are all playing in conference title games this week after joining their new leagues this season.\n\nPenn State is 4-12 all-time against the No. 1 team in the AP Top 25: I know 4-12 doesn't seem like a good record, but keep in mind No. 1 teams don't lose very often. That's why they're No. 1. Winning 25% of those 16 games is better than most programs. While the Nittany Lions have enjoyed success, there hasn't been much lately. The last win over a No. 1 team came in 1990 against Notre Dame. They haven't done it since joining the Big Ten.\n\nOregon vs. Penn State prediction, picks\n\nI've seen plenty of surprise from fans and media alike that Oregon is only a 3.5-point favorite in the game, but the spread makes sense to me. There's far too much attention paid to Penn State's inability to beat Ohio State and it overshadows the fact the Nittany Lions are a genuinely good team! But if I'm taking a side in this game, I'm going with the Ducks. While both teams are evenly-matched across the board, there's one spot that Oregon has a big advantage: at receiver. Penn State's entire passing attack is built through Tyler Warren, and he's awesome, but what if Oregon takes him away? What's the counter? Oregon has plenty of options, and it should be enough to make the difference.

      "full_content": "The Bulldogs won a first-round bye, but now must wait to see the extent of injury to their starting QB\n\nATLANTA — So it turns out conference championships between two playoff-bound teams still have a whole lot of significance ... especially if one of those teams looks very different after the game than it did before.\n\nA year ago almost to the day, the college football world learned that sometimes, undefeated isn’t good enough to make the playoffs, if you lose your starting quarterback along the way. Georgia isn’t undefeated, not even close, and the Bulldogs also lost Carson Beck, their starting quarterback, in the SEC championship. How will Beck's injury affect Georgia's playoff possibilities going forward?\n\nGeorgia eliminated any need for a CFP selection committee judgment call by winning the SEC championship 22-19 in OT over a mistake-prone Texas. While it's unlikely Georgia will fall out of a No. 2 seed, thanks to its strength of schedule, it's possible. And it's still an open question as to just how injured Beck is.\n\n\"He's got an upper extremity injury,\" Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said of Beck after the game. \"We don't know to what extent. Basically we looked at it in there. It looked OK. But he couldn't have grip strength and throw the ball in the locker room. It was a little bit painful for that. We need to at the end of the day [find] out exactly what's going on, have an MRI, look into it.\"\n\nBeck was injured on the final play of the first half, a chaotic sack and fumble that very nearly ended up as a Texas touchdown. Beck remained prone on the field for several seconds after taking the sack.\n\nA whole lot happened on the final play of the first half. pic.twitter.com/KbTz6SV8wp — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) December 7, 2024\n\nAt the conclusion of halftime, three Georgia quarterbacks began warming up on the sideline, and none of them were Beck. Backup Gunner Stockton got the nod, and he immediately led a motivated Georgia offense to the first touchdown scored by either team on the afternoon. Later in the third quarter, Stockton drove Georgia deep into Texas territory and came away with a field goal.\n\n\"Of course it's never a good thing when your starting quarterback goes out,\" Georgia offensive guard Tate Ratledge said after the game. \"I think it was big for everybody in the locker room to let Gunner know that we believed in him and had full confidence in him to get the job done.\"\n\nTexas, for its part, faced two foes on Saturday: Georgia, and its own repeated mistakes and penalties. Texas penalties kept Georgia in the game the first half, negating two interceptions and a made field goal. Texas errors, including two missed field goals, gave hope to the Georgia sideline and motivation to the overwhelmingly pro-Georgia crowd in Atlanta.\n\n\"The challenge in games like this is to maximize the opportunities when you get them,\" Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian said. \"In the first half we had some great opportunities, and we just couldn't capitalize the way we would have liked.\"\n\nAnd then came the fourth quarter, and these two teams remembered that they were playing for the championship of the mighty Southeastern Conference. Texas struck first, evening the score at 13 on a Quinn Ewers' dart to DeAndre Moore for 41 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDeAndre Moore Jr with the TD and Texas retakes the lead! pic.twitter.com/e2NI9UObh4 — Mr Matthew CFB (@MrMatthew_CFB) December 7, 2024\n\nOn its very next drive, Georgia executed a flawless, gutsy fake punt on fourth-and-5, catching the Longhorn defense napping with an end-around run for 9 yards. Twice on the drive, Georgia fumbled the ball, and twice recovered its own fumble. Georgia controlled the ball for 9:22 of the fourth quarter, covering 72 yards in 16 plays, but couldn't quite punch in the ball, and had to settle for a go-ahead field goal to put the score at 16-13.\n\nSo that put the ball in Ewers' hands with 4:32 remaining and the SEC championship on the line ... and Ewers promptly threw the ball straight into the hands of Georgia's Daylen Everette. That marked Everette's second interception of Ewers on the afternoon and gave Stockton the opportunity to bleed clock.\n\nBut then Stockton's inexperience showed, to devastating effect. On a broken play, he heaved up a pass toward the Texas sideline that ended up in the hands of Texas' Jahdae Barron. That gave Ewers another chance to prove himself. He came through with a clutch fourth-and-3 conversion with just over a minute left in the game, and his end-zone pass to Ryan Wingo drew a critical pass-interference call on Georgia that put the ball at the Georgia 14 with 35 seconds remaining.\n\nEwers couldn't put the ball into the end zone, and that meant Texas' fate would rely on the foot of kicker Bert Auburn, who had missed twice already. His 36-yard attempt flew true, tying the game at 16 with 18 seconds remaining.\n\nIn overtime, Texas took the ball first. Ewers misfired on pass after end-zone pass, and again the Longhorns had to settle for a field goal attempt. Again, Auburn converted, this time from 27 yards out, to give the Longhorns a 19-16 lead.\n\nThat put the ball in Stockton's hands again. After guiding the Bulldogs down to the Texas 12, he took off and ran the ball himself, taking a vicious, helmet-loosening hit from Texas' Andrew Mukuba at the 4-yard line. One play later, Trevor Etienne forced his way into the end zone for a 22-19 Georgia victory. (Beck, still in pads, subbed onto the field to hand the ball off on the game-winning play, but he was noticeably uncomfortable.)\n\nThe question now facing Georgia is how injured Beck is, and what effect that might have on the perception of the Bulldogs. Injuries and speculative effects shouldn’t impact a school’s seeding … but as 2023 showed, injuries can negate an entire season’s work in the eyes of the CFP selection committee.\n\nLast year, Florida State finished the regular season undefeated and won the ACC championship despite the fact that it lost quarterback Jordan Travis to season-ending injury along the way. When selecting the members of the four-team bracket, the College Football Playoff selection committee decided that Travis’ absence made Florida State a materially worse team and selected Alabama as the fourth seed instead.\n\nGeorgia didn’t suffer an immediate quality drop-off after Beck left the game; indeed, the Bulldogs looked far sharper in the third quarter around Stockton than they had all first half around Beck. But the late fourth-quarter interception was a brutal blow that allowed Texas to tie the game and force overtime. Fortunately for Georgia and Stockton — and unlike last week's eight-overtime victory against Georgia Tech — the Bulldogs only needed one overtime period to erase that mistake and claim the SEC title."

      "full_content": "Not too long ago, it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that: (1) the season would end; (2) Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy’s contract would expire; and (3) the Cowboys would hire someone else.\n\nWhat a difference two straight wins makes.\n\nIn the days since Jerry Jones called the prospect of McCarthy staying “not crazy,” key players have voiced support for McCarthy. First, it was quarterback Dak Prescott, who said he “wholeheartedly” supports McCarthy. Now, it’s linebacker Micah Parsons.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN that will be televised before Monday night’s Bengals-Cowboys game, Parsons made the case for continuity.\n\n“I think I would like a fair shot with everyone back -- players, coaches -- because the injuries kind of struck of what this season could really be,” Parsons said, via Todd Archer of ESPN.com. “The injuries have been terrible. And, you know, it really sucks. Seeing Zack [Martin], [DeMarcus Lawrence] not having the year I know he planned to have. He had such a great start. It really sucks.\n\n“In terms of coaching, man, Coach Mike, me and his relationship has always been really good. He always took real good care of me. I just don’t know how the how the business side of it’s going to go, you know? [ Jerry Jones] has his own mindset about who he wants to coach. This is his team. I’m kind of just, like, a pawn in this business.”\n\nParsons is right. Jerry ultimately will do whatever he wants to do. But it can’t hurt to have key players wanting McCarthy to return.\n\nIt also can’t hurt to have McCarthy sufficiently concerned about getting fired that he’ll drive not as hard of a bargain as he would have for a new deal. Which might be the ultimate method to Jerry’s apparent madness."

      "full_content": "Emilia Pérez got an early boost in its awards campaign on Saturday night by cleaning up at the 37th European Film Awards, handed out in Lucerne, Switzerland.\n\nJacques Audiard’s Spanish-language transgender musical won best film, best director and best screenplay honors for Audiard. Karla Sofía Gascón, who plays the titular character, won best actress, becoming the first trans performer to win in the category.\n\n“I didn’t prepare anything because I was sure I wasn’t going to receive anything tonight,” said Gascón, accepting her prize. She thanked Audiard, “the best European director for making the best European actress.” Gascón dedicated here prize “to my mother and to all mothers in this world because their values and their function are sometimes undervalued, [and] I would like to devote this prize to all families and ask all parents to love their children, because, unfortunately, in this world, there are families that prefer their children be criminals than gay people.”\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón at the 2024 European Film Awards Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images\n\nAudiard dedicated his best screenwriting honor to the late, French-Danish actor Niels Arestrup, who the director worked with on films such as The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005) and A Prophet (2009).\n\nHoisting his best film trophy, Audiard reminded the crowd that “all of us here in this room are so lucky to be making films in Europe.” He said he would like his country, with its generous government support of cinema, “to serve as an example for all other countries in Europe.”\n\nEmilia Pérez is France’s official submission for the Academy Awards in the best international feature category and a strong contender for several categories, including best actress for Gascón, supporting honors for co-stars Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, and multiple technical categories.\n\nJacques Audiard at the 2024 European Film Awards Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images\n\nGuinean actor Abou Sangare beat out heavyweights Ralph Fiennes, Daniel Craig and Germany’s Lars Eidinger to take the best actor prize for Boris Lojkine’s Souleymane’s Story, where he plays an African immigrant in Paris struggling to survive and get legalization papers so he can stay.\n\nThere were few overtly political statements at the awards, but Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass, presenting the best film award, called on the audience to think of the children of Gaza. “If they ever dreamt or had anything to say or any horizon, death has vanished all their dreams.”\n\nThe winners of best documentary No Other Land, which follows the Israeli government’s systematic and violent evictions of Palestinians in the West Bank, used the occasion to speak out against the war in Gaza. Accepting the prize via Zoom, Basel Adra, one of the film’s Palestinian directors, said it was difficult to celebrate with the ongoing “genocide against my people. How Israel is systemically trying to erase us from our homes.” Yuval Abraham, his Israeli co-director, called for action from European governments to pressure the Israeli government to enter a ceasefire by stopping the supply of weapons to Jerusalem. “For the sake of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza [at] risk of death, for the sake of the hundreds of Israeli hostages, a ceasefire has to be imposed.”\n\nFlow, Latvia’s Oscar hopeful for best international feature, as well as a best animated feature contender, took the European Film Award for best animated feature. The dialog-free drama follows a big-eyed cat caught in an apocalyptic flood who teams up with a geographically diverse pack of critters to escape.\n\nThe prize for best short film went to Croatian director Nebojsa Slijepcevic’s The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent, an Oscar frontrunner that won the Palme d’Or earlier this year. The film dramatizes the Štrpci massacre of 1993, when 24 Bosniak Muslims were pulled off a train by a Serbian paramilitary group and only one man, the Croatian Tomo Buzov, stood up against the attackers.\n\nAfter the Yugoslav War, said Slijepcevic, Buzov’s story was forgotten “because it didn’t fit into any of the narratives, but now it won’t be.”\n\nThe European Young Audience Award went to the animated documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, which premiered at Sundance and was snatched up by Netflix.\n\nArmand, a school-set drama from Norwegian director Halfdan Ullmann Tøndel and the country’s best international feature contender for the Oscars, won the European Discovery prize for best first feature.\n\nWinners in the craft categories were announced ahead of Saturday’s gala, with The Substance picking up trophies for best cinematography and best visual effects, The Girl With the Needle taking best score and best production design, and Emilia Pérez winning best editing, among others.\n\nIconic German director Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas, Pina, Perfect Days) received a European lifetime achievement award. The long list of video tributes to Wenders included clips from Martin Scorsese, Willem Dafoe, Nick Cave and, in a showstopper, Japanese actor Kôji Yakusho, star of Wenders’ Perfect Days, who appeared in character from the film, scrubbing a Toyko public toilet. “Mr. Director! In celebration, I will clean your toilet,” Yakusho quipped. “Prost!”\n\nReceiving his trophy from EFA President Juliette Binoche, Wenders made the first Trump joke of the night. “Thank you, Madame President. So many of us would have liked to call another lady Madame President, but that didn’t happen. If it had, the world would be a better place. But while that other guy pretends to make America great again, this president has a chance to make European cinema shine again.”\n\nWim Wenders at the 2024 European Film Awards Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images\n\nClosing his speech, Wenders quoted another U.S. president, John F. Kennedy, calling on the film professionals in the room to ask not what Europe could do for them but what they could do for Europe. “Europe is in trouble right now,” Wenders said, “and I really urge you to think what you can do for Europe because Europe needs you. It needs the film community to produce a more positive, more emotional view of the continent [because] too many people think of it as an economic community, a financial community, but it is an emotional community. It gives us strength, and right now we should give it strength.”\n\nItalian actress Isabella Rossellini was honored with the European Achievement in World Cinema award, presented to her by her Conclave co-star Ralph Fiennes.\n\n“She can claim a pretty decent heritage,” said Fiennes, referencing Rossellini’s legendary filmmaking parents, Oscar-winning actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian neo-realist director Roberto Rossellini, before listing off the “extraordinary talents” she has worked with in her career. “David Lynch, Robert Zemeckis, Peter Weir, Abel Ferrara, Guy Madden, Denis Villeneuve, Alice Rohrwacher and Edward Berger. You might think that they chose her, but for the most part, she chose them.”\n\nWhile accepting the award, Rossellini said, “If I had to define the engine, the motor of my life, I would say it has been curiosity and the fuel for this motor has been laughter.” She thanked the babysitters who cared for her children when she was off working. “If it wasn’t for the wonderful work of other women who helped me, I couldn’t have the career I have had,” she said. “This is true for all of us women that have careers. My mother said to me the same thing: ‘If it wasn’t for our Jenny, our nanny, I couldn’t have had the career I had. I am as grateful to her, Jenny, as I am to a director of the caliber of Alfred Hitchcock.'”\n\nIsabella Rossellini at the 2024 European Film Awards Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images\n\nMacedonian producer and actress Labina Mitevska won this year’s Eurimages International Co-production Award, honoring producers for their contribution to fostering international film collaboration.\n\nSee the full list of 2024 European Film Award winners below.\n\nEuropean Film\n\nEmilia Pérez (France), directed by Jacques Audiard, produced by Pascal Caucheteux, Jacques Audiard, Valérie Schermann & Anthony Vaccarello\n\nEuropean Documentary\n\nNo Other Land (Palestine, Norway), directed by Yuval Abraham, Rachel Szor, Basel Adra & Hamdan Ballal, produced by Fabien Greenberg, Bård Kjøge Rønning, Yuval Abraham, Basel Adra, Rachel Szor & Hamdan Ballal\n\nEuropean Director\n\nJacques Audiard for Emilia Pérez\n\nEuropean Actress\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón in Emilia Pérez\n\nEuropean Actor\n\nAbou Sangare in Souleymane’s Story\n\nEuropean Screenwriter\n\nJacques Audiard for Emilia Pérez\n\nEuropean Discovery – Prix FIPRESCI\n\nArmand (Norway, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden), directed by Halfdan Ullmann Tøndel, produced by Andrea Berentsen Ottmar\n\nEuropean Animated Feature Film\n\nFlow, directed by Gints Zilbalodis\n\nEuropean Short Film\n\nThe Man Who Could Not Remain Silent, directed by Nebojsa Slijepcevic\n\nEuropean Young Audience Award\n\nThe Remarkable Life of Ibelin (Norway), directed by Benjamin Ree, produced by Ingvil Giske\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nThe Substance (Benjamin Kračun)\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nThe Substance (Bryan Jones, Pierre Procoudine-Gorsky, Chervin Shafaghi, Guillaume Le Gouez)\n\nBest Production Design\n\nThe Girl With the Needle (Jagna Dobesz)\n\nBest Original Score\n\nThe Girl With the Needle (Frederikke Hoffmeier)\n\nBest Editing\n\nEmilia Pérez (Juliette Welfling)\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nThe Devil’s Bath (Tanja Hausner)\n\nBest Make-Up & Hair\n\nWhen the Light Breaks (Evalotte Oosterop)\n\nBest Sound\n\nSouleymane’s Story (Marc-Olivier Brullé, Pierre Bariaud, Charlotte Butrak, Samuel Aïchoun, Rodrigo Diaz)\n\nEuropean University Film Award\n\nThree Kilometers to the End of the World (director Emanuel Pârvu)\n\nEuropean Lifetime Achievement\n\nWim Wenders\n\nEuropean Achievement in World Cinema\n\nIsabella Rossellini\n\nEurimages International Co-Production\n\nLabina Mitevska"

After deactivating his Instagram on Friday night, he returned to X with a statement asking fans and strangers to be “respectful” of him and his loved ones after his name was “dragged across the internet” since his breakup news with Sabrina Carpenter dropped on Tuesday. “The messages I have received no person should ever have to read them. Absolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent, and every other inhumane thing you can imagine,” Keoghan wrote on December 7. “Dragging my character and everything I worked extremely hard for and stand for. Talking about how I was a heroine baby and how I grew up and dragging my dear mother into it also. Knocking on my grannies door. Sitting outside my baby boys house intimidating them. Thats crossing a line.”\n\nSince Tuesday, when the news of the breakup was first reported, internet sleuths began claiming that Keoghan cheated on Carpenter, with some suggesting he cheated with influencer Breckie Hill, which may have been a reason as to why he’s been on the receiving end of so much hate. “I need you to remeber he has to read ALL of this about his father when he is older. Please be respectful to all Thank u,” Keoghan concluded."

This weekend will mark the end of the tour.\n\nSwift has been on the road for a year and a half, and Friday night’s performance is her 149th performance. Athlon Sports reported she joked to the crowd, “This is a little known fact, not many people know this, it hasn’t been talked about very much, but let me give you some information that you probably don’t already know! Vancouver is actually the VERY LAST city that we play on the eras tour.”\n\nIM SO EXCITED TO GO SEE THE DOCUMENTARY �� �� �� if it’s streaming then ill host a watch party — mimi !

Speculation ran rife on social media that Swift is planning a documentary to be released in the months that will follow the tour’s end.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameras have also followed Swift when she’s attended Kansas City Chiefs football games to see her boyfriend, Travis Kelce.

She spent most of 2023 in the United States before shifting overseas and has since performed in Tokyo, Australia, Singapore, France, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Poland, England, Scotland, Wales and Toronto.

      "full_content": "No. 15 ASU football will be in the College Football Playoff bracket on Sunday after it dominated No. 16 Iowa State 45-19 in the Big 12 Championship Game on Saturday.\n\nAlthough the Sun Devils can rest easy knowing they’re in, they won’t know their opponent — as well as whether they’ll get a first-round bye — until the selection show on Sunday at 10 a.m. MST on ESPN.\n\n“I think we should be treated as an 11-1 team,” head coach Kenny Dillingham told ESPN reporter Katie George postgame, referring to ASU’s loss at Cincinnati without quarterback Sam Leavitt.\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, you’ve punched your ticket to [Glendale for the Fiesta Bowl],” Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said before handing the championship trophy to Dillingham.\n\nBye weeks are awarded to the four highest-rated conference champions, according to the committee’s rankings.\n\nSaturday night’s ACC Championship Game between No. 8 SMU and No. 17 Clemson will likely be the indicator, as SMU would almost certainly hang on to its bye slot with a win.\n\nNo. 10 Boise State beat No. 20 UNLV at home in the Mountain West title game on Saturday to likely maintain its bye.\n\nHowever, the point differential of ASU’s dominant win could factor into the seeding too, as the committee weighs Boise State’s 14-point win over a No. 20 team at home against ASU’s 26-point win over a No. 16 team on a neutral field.\n\nThe first two bye slots will likely go to the SEC and Big Ten champions, as No. 2 Texas and No. 5 Georgia will square off at 2 p.m. and No. 1 Oregon and No. 3 Penn State play at 6 p.m.\n\nWhat could ASU’s first playoff game look like?\n\nThe Sun Devils could potentially be set up for a Fiesta Bowl appearance in the quarterfinal with a bye week or a first-round win.\n\nIf it doesn’t get the bye week, ASU would likely be one of the final teams slotted in, even if the blowout win allows the Sun Devils to jump No. 11 Alabama.\n\nNo bye week would likely mean going on the road to play the loser of the SEC or Big Ten title game on their campus in the first round. Notre Dame could also host the first-round matchup.\n\nThe first round will be played on Dec. 21, with one game starting the previous Friday night at 6 p.m. MST. The Fiesta Bowl on Dec. 31 is the first quarterfinal before the rest are played on Jan. 1.\n\nFollow along Sunday on the Arizona Sports app or online for more on ASU’s CFP outlook."

      "full_content": "Mark Cuban's Favorite Shark Tank Product Was Created Just For 'Dudes' And Is Raking In Over $100 Million A Year: 'Wipe Early, Wipe Often'\n\nWhen Mark Cuban was asked about his favorite Shark Tank investment during an interview on Good Morning America, he didn't hesitate: DUDE Wipes. In an Instagram reel posted in October, Cuban joked, \"We all gotta wipe, right?\" He added, \"Everything's a potty joke to them. Business is great. They're killing it. They're gonna do one-hundred-plus million dollars this year. So wipe early, wipe often.\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/DBJXztgC5jf\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThat offbeat humor is at the core of DUDE Wipes' success. Launched in 2011 by childhood friends from the Chicago suburbs – Sean Riley, Ryan Meegan and Jeffrey Klimkowski – the company has gone from a quirky idea to a serious disrupter in the $11 billion toilet paper industry. In 2023 alone, the brand raked in $110 million in revenue, up from $70 million the year before and now holds a 1% market share in a space dominated by giants like Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble.\n\nThe concept of DUDE Wipes started as a simple hack: Riley stocked their shared apartment bathroom with baby wipes. The roommates realized that while traditional toilet paper wasn't cutting it, baby wipes, let alone men, weren't marketed for adults.\n\nFrom that lightbulb moment, they sketched their prototype, pooled together $30,000 in savings and ordered their first batch of wipes. With just $5,000 left for marketing, they began handing out samples at college campuses, music festivals and fraternity houses.\n\nSee Also: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started.\n\n\"We didn't have any money for marketing, but we had a product,\" Riley explained.\n\nDUDE Wipes got its big break on Shark Tank in 2015. With their bold pitch – telling Mark Cuban that his \"a** hates him\" for using dry toilet paper – they secured a $300,000 investment for 25% of the company. Cuban's investment remains the only outside funding they've ever taken.\n\nFast forward to today and DUDE Wipes is now a staple in over 20,000 stores, including Walmart, Target and Kroger. This year, they expanded to Sam's Club and Costco. They've also doubled down on irreverent marketing, including Super Bowl billboards poking fun at pop culture figures like Taylor Swift (\"It's me. Hi. I'm the solution. It's me. Not TP.\") and Travis Kelce (\"We love a clean tight end, too.\")."

One of my main predictions for 2025 is that mergers and acquisitions will see a comeback amid an improving macroeconomic picture and the high likelihood that leadership at the FTC changes under the incoming administration.\n\nOne company that I see as an attractive acquisition candidate is SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which specializes in voice-recognition assistants powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Below, I'm going to detail why speech recognition is an important component of the AI ecosystem, and explore why SoundHound AI looks like a logical acquisition prospect.\n\nWhy is voice-powered AI so important?\n\nVoice-enabled AI uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to train devices to understand and process words and phrases. Common applications of this technology include Internet of Things (IoT) appliances such as smart thermostats or assistants like Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe AI embedded in these tools can help you set reminders, obtain general information by asking a question, or even change the temperature throughout your home -- all by leveraging your voice and removing any manual or physical steps in between.\n\nAccording to Statista, the global total addressable market (TAM) for speech recognition is estimated to reach $15.9 billion by 2030 -- slightly more than double what it is worth today.\n\nWhile there is clear demand for AI-powered speech recognition, which businesses are actually investing in this technology? The answer may surprise you.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat companies are investing in voice assistants?\n\nIn addition to Amazon, the companies listed below have invested significantly into AI voice assistants over the last several years:\n\nAlphabet: Similar to Amazon, it also has a line of smart-home products. The company's Google Home devices are essentially a direct competitor to Amazon's Alexa, while the company's smart-home products -- including speakers, thermostats, doorbells and locks, and much more -- are sold under its Nest brand.\n\nMicrosoft: A couple of years ago, the company acquired a developer of AI voice recognition called Nuance for nearly $20 billion. Nuance gained traction in a few crucial end markets, but mainly focused on healthcare. For Microsoft, the deal represented an opportunity to leverage a new type of technology while also allowing the company to cross-sell its various services -- particular its Azure cloud computing infrastructure -- to major organizations already working with Nuance. Its partner OpenAI has also been experimenting with voice-powered AI tools. Although it's still early days, Microsoft appears to be well positioned in the speech recognition segment of the AI landscape.\n\nStory Continues"

      "full_content": "Making a retirement budget calls for considering not only income but also expenses. With $2,700 monthly from Social Security and $715,000 in 401(k) accounts invested and distributed conservatively, a couple may be able to expect about $61,000 in annual income. This is close to the annual expense level reported by the average retiree. However, individual retiree couples may have significantly higher or lower expenses based on individual situations. A more customized spending plan might account for past and predicted outlays for major cost categories such as housing, food, transportation, healthcare and taxes. To ensure your retirement budget aligns with your long-term goals and financial situation, schedule a consultation with a qualified financial advisor today.\n\nBudget Basics\n\nA retirement budget is an outline of the expenses and income a retiree can expect after leaving the workforce. Creating a retirement budget is a key part of retirement planning. It helps identify potential financial pinches when cash could run short, and accounts for taxes along the way. It can also suggest solutions, such as trimming expenses or increasing income.\n\nThe goal of a retirement budget is to balance income and expenses. It should include a cushion of excess income over expenses to help provide for the unexpected. Flexibility is another vital component. No matter how carefully a budget is prepared, it’s a plan subject to modification and not an iron-clad course of action.\n\nRetiree budgets resemble budgets used to plan the financial affairs of businesses, governments and pre-retirement households, but differences exist. Without jobs generating wages and salaries and the possibility of increasing earnings with overtime or bonuses, retirees may have less flexibility with regard to income than people still working. Retirees also generally have lower expenses for common categories such as housing, education, childcare and, of course, retirement saving.\n\nRetirement Income\n\nOn the income side, Social Security is a central part of most retiree budgets. A $2,700 combined Social Security income is equal to $32,400 in annual income. While there is a chance Social Security benefits will be significantly reduced around 2035, the program’s long history of uninterrupted payments coupled with the government’s taxing authority suggests it is as reliable as any income source including investments. Social Security benefits also adjust annually to reflect cost of living changes, so it’s inflation-protected.\n\nThe income potential of $715,000 in 401(k) plans is less clear-cut, but it’s possible to create a generally trustworthy estimate using the 4% rule. This guideline assumes a retiree can withdraw 4% of the principal in a retirement account each year, adjusting annually for inflation, without running out of money for at least 30 years."

Berkshire has held American Express for three decades now, and it will likely remain a core holding in its portfolio over the long term. Here's why.\n\nWhy Buffett likes American Express\n\nAmerican Express's business history stretches back 174 years, but it didn't enter the credit card market until the 1950s. Under the leadership of then-CEO Ralph Reed, the company strategically positioned its card as a premium offering by setting its annual fee $1 higher than that of rival Diner's Club.\n\nOver the years, American Express's strong brand has attracted a high-spending, premium customer base. One prime example of its high-end brand strategy is its invite-only Black Card, which reportedly requires $250,000 in annual spending and has an annual fee of $5,000.\n\nIt also offers a more affordable (but still pricey) Platinum Card with an annual fee of $695. That card is meant to appeal to high-spending consumers with benefits that include access to airport lounges, hotel perks, travel rewards, and spending credits for dining and entertainment.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThis strong brand is why Buffett and his right-hand man, the late Charlie Munger, purchased American Express stock in the 1990s, and why it has remained in the portfolio ever since, making it one of Berkshire's longest-held positions.\n\nWhen Stephen Squeri took the reins of American Express as CEO in 2018, Buffett reminded him: \"The most important thing about American Express is the brand and the customers that aspire to be associated with the brand.\"\n\nAmerican Express's business model\n\nWith $1.1 trillion in U.S. transaction volume in 2023, American Express is the third-most-used card brand behind Visa and Mastercard.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF does charge an expense ratio of 0.12%, but that's fairly low for ETFs in general. Plus, this ETF greatly simplifies your taxes versus owning cryptocurrencies directly.

I’m aware that the earnings are subject to penalty before five years but I won’t need that money until at least age 70. Is it advisable to do so? My annual income from a pension is $65,000 and I have $100,000 in my IRA.\n\n– Thomas\n\nYes, a Roth conversion is worth considering and may very well be worth doing. I’ll go over some of the main points that you may want to consider as you think about whether or not you want to follow through with a conversion.\n\nBut before we jump in, a side note on your comment about waiting five years: there are three different Roth IRA five-year rules, and two of them frequently get mixed up and cause a lot of confusion.\n\nSince you’re over 59 ½, you won’t be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty associated with distributions taken less than five years after a Roth conversion. However, if this is your first Roth IRA, then yes, you’ll need to wait five years to withdraw earnings tax-free. (And if you have similar questions about Roth conversions or other retirement planning topics, speak with a financial advisor.)\n\nWhy Do a Roth Conversion?\n\nA Roth conversion can be a wise strategic maneuver for retirement income planning.\n\nSaving money on taxes is the primary reason for doing a Roth conversion. In your situation, I think there are a couple of reasons that a Roth conversion could help with your tax liability.\n\nYour Income and Tax Bracket\n\nFirst, you’re in a fairly low tax bracket to begin with. If you have no income other than the pension you’ve mentioned, then it’s reasonable to think you are in the 22% marginal tax bracket if you’re single. Otherwise, you may be in the 12% tax bracket if you’re married and file a joint return with your spouse.\n\nBecause your income is from a pension, there’s also no reason to think your nominal income is going to fall in the future. This means that other than the slight annual adjustments to the tax brackets over time, you shouldn’t expect to fall into a lower bracket later.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Unless Congress extends them or implements some other broad tax cut, income tax rates will go up and standard deductions back down.\n\nIt may make sense to go ahead and fill up your current bracket with Roth conversions gradually over a few years. Of course, also consider your state income taxes or if you plan to move to a state that doesn’t have income tax. (But if you need more help building a retirement income plan or optimizing your tax strategy in retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.)\n\nStory Continues"

Investors continue to flock to seemingly any stock with the slightest connection with artificial intelligence (AI). They're especially bullish about artificial intelligence (AI) giants including Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. Plenty of other megacap stocks that aren't in the technology space, such as American Express and Walmart, have also chalked up huge gains.\n\nHowever, small-cap stocks have lagged behind large-cap stocks for years. Value investors have also seen the kinds of stocks they prefer trail behind as investors enthused over sexier growth stocks. If you think this hasn't boded well for the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VBR), which owns small-cap value stocks, you're right. As of July 1, the ETF had risen by only 0.33% year to date, while the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF was up 24%.\n\nBut it's a much different story now. Over the last few months, the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has taken off. The ETF reached a record high in late November and is still close to that level.\n\nMost of the 836 stocks in this Vanguard ETF's portfolio aren't anywhere close to being as glamorous as Nvidia and Walmart. Its top holdings include stocks such as Smurfit WestRock and EMCOR Group. You probably won't see much coverage on these stocks. However, many of them are gaining steam.\n\nWhy this Vanguard ETF could go much higher\n\nI think this momentum will continue, pushing the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF much higher. This ETF has several tailwinds that are either already blowing, or could do so soon.\n\nArguably the most important one is that the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates twice over the last three months. Small-cap stocks tend to be especially sensitive to interest rates. Smaller companies often rely more heavily on borrowing than larger companies. Lower rates translate to lower borrowing costs and higher profits.\n\nThere are also good prospects for deregulation in a second Trump administration. President-elect Trump has promised to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation added. If he delivers on this pledge, it should be great news for smaller companies. Regulatory costs frequently hit smaller companies harder than larger companies. Trump's proposed steep tariffs on all imports to the U.S. could also benefit many small-cap companies that compete with rivals based outside the U.S.\n\nStory Continues"

      "full_content": "A low-savings retirement is one in which you don’t have enough money in your portfolio to generate a comfortable retirement income. For example, let’s say that you’re 65 and have $120,000 in a retirement portfolio. We’ll assume that this money is in a pre-tax 401(k). This won’t generate a livable income on its own. That doesn’t mean it’s too late to make plans, though, or that you can’t live a secure and comfortable life. But it will take some thought, sacrifice and planning.\n\nHere are some things to consider in your planning. You can also get matched with a fiduciary financial advisor who can help you build and execute an appropriate and custom retirement plan.\n\nPlan for Your Retirement Income\n\nAs you approach retirement, no matter what your situation, the first thing to do is take stock of your income and assets. What will generate income for you? What level of earnings are reliable? What assets can you convert to cash? What benefits, pensions or other payments will you receive? Are you eligible for Social Security benefits?\n\nFor example, say that you own your own home. In this case, a sale or a reverse mortgage can often generate a significant cash boost to supplement your savings.\n\nIn this case, we’re assuming you only have two potential retirement income streams on hand: Social Security and a $120,000 401(k). So, we start planning from there. What income can you expect from each asset?\n\nFor your portfolio, this will depend on how you manage your money. This is a profile where an annuity might be a very strong option, as these can sometimes maximize the value of relatively small portfolios. For example, say that you begin to take retirement at age 70. A representative annuity might generate $1,081 per month ($12,972 per year). While exposed to inflation, this income is significantly higher than the roughly $400 to $600 per month you could expect from a 4% withdrawal strategy off the same amount.\n\nFor Social Security, unfortunately this is a profile where you likely won’t qualify for maximum benefits. Social Security is built to maximize benefits for higher-earning households: The more you earn while working, the more you collect in benefits, to a point.\n\nStill, assuming you’ve paid into the program, your next step is to begin planning for your actual Social Security income. You can visit the SSA and get a report on your actual benefits and credits, or you can use SmartAsset’s calculator for a likely estimate. Once you know what you will receive, you can begin to plan for that income. Your actual benefits will depend entirely on how much you earned over your working life, and for how many years. However, by way of example, the average retiree received $1,907 per month ($22,884 per year) in benefits."

      "full_content": "A couple looks over their finances as they decide whether to get an annuity or invest in a target date fund.\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nAnnuities and target date funds are popular assets for households who are either saving for retirement or already in their golden years. How useful each may be for you depends on your financial goals and where you are on your path to retirement.\n\nFor example, John and Susan are both 67 and recently retired. They have $1.2 million in a pre-tax IRA, $750,000 in taxable investments and collects $45,000 in annual Social Security benefits. Should they shift their assets to a target date fund or an annuity?\n\nHere’s how to look at each asset in context. (And if you need help assessing which investments and strategies make the most sense for you, consider speaking with a financial advisor.)\n\nInvesting in an Annuity\n\nAnnuities are an income-oriented financial product that you purchase from an insurance company. In exchange for an up-front investment on your part the company promises a set series of payments over time that return both your initial investment plus a rate of interest.\n\nFor retirees, the most popular version of this is a lifetime annuity. These are contracts that guarantee a fixed, monthly payment for the rest of your life. They are also known as private pension plans, and they can be extremely useful for people looking for security. Once you buy this annuity, the only risk to your income is the unlikely event of the insurance company’s insolvency.\n\nWhat if our hypothetical couple John and Susan shifted all of their money into annuities? First, investing their $1.2 million IRA in an annuity could yield approximately $82,220 per year ($6,851 per month) in pre-tax income from a single premium immediate annuity, according to Schwab’s Income Annuity Estimator. So long as you invest in a qualified annuity, you can typically do this without triggering an immediate tax event.\n\nBut suppose John and Susan want even more guaranteed income and sell their $750,000 portfolio, investing the proceeds in an annuity. After paying capital gains taxes (we’ll assume they had a $75,000 cost basis), John and Susan are left with approximately $558,000. They could use that money to purchase a separate annuity that pays approximately $38,280 per year ($3,190 per month).\n\nIn total, John and Susan would have around $120,500 per year in annuity income, before taxes, if they used their $1.95 million to purchase annuities.\n\nWhile the two annuities would provide the couple with a constant stream of income for the rest of their lives, John and Susan would have to manage inflation risk since these payments would be fixed. Unlike Social Security benefits, many annuities are not indexed for inflation (you can purchase an inflation-protected annuity, but it’s likely going to cost you more). Unless the couple has a plan to use other investments to make up for the rising cost of living, the value of their annuity income could drop considerably over the course of a long retirement."

      "full_content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continues to shatter records in 2024 after a brutal crypto winter that began two years earlier. The world's largest cryptocurrency reached beyond $100,000 for the very first time on Dec. 4 and continued in the plus-$100,000 range until the next day. Since then, bitcoin’s price has backed off somewhat.\n\nBitcoin’s price, now up over 35% since the presidential election, exceeded the $70,000 mark for the first time in March 2024. Driving the surge was the SEC’s approval of new bitcoin spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, that made it easier to invest in bitcoin with a brokerage account, or even a retirement account.\n\nBitcoin's price hit the $70,000 mark again when the first ethereum ETFs started trading in July after getting the green light from the SEC two months earlier.\n\nAs bitcoin becomes more mainstream and clears new records, is it time to join the party? Proceed with caution.\n\nRead more news: 'CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!': Trump cheers bitcoin rally after cryptocurrency tops $100,000 for first time\n\nWhat’s the big deal about bitcoin ETFs?\n\nIn early 2023, a Pew Research Center survey found that 75% of Americans who’d heard of cryptocurrency said they weren’t confident in its safety or reliability.\n\nBut the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency began climbing again later that year after a federal appeals court ruled that the SEC wrongfully rejected an application from Grayscale Investments to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC said in October 2023 that it wouldn’t appeal the court ruling.\n\nAnd in January, it gave the OK to nearly a dozen new exchange-traded funds called spot bitcoin ETFs. Spot ETFs own the underlying asset — like gold, silver, or now bitcoin — and closely track its price, minus trading costs or fees.\n\nLearn more: Gold is hovering near all-time highs. Here's how investors can play the craze.\n\n“There have not been any ETFs like this before,” said Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. “There are ETFs that invest in stocks of companies that do business in the crypto industry, such as exchanges and miners, and there are ETFs that trade futures in bitcoin, which is like buying equity options instead of stocks, but until now there have not been any ETFs that directly invest in and own bitcoin.”\n\nThe SEC’s decision allows investors to get direct exposure to bitcoin without going through a crypto exchange or dealing with the headache of storage or security issues. Instead, investors can easily gain bitcoin exposure by owning shares in their brokerage accounts, including individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\n\n“The new spot bitcoin ETFs are widely viewed as the safest from a custody perspective because the ETFs are regulated by the SEC, and they handle the safeguarding of your bitcoin for you,” Edelman said.\n\nRead more news: The 4 groups of bitcoin people to know: Morning Brief\n\nDoes bitcoin belong in an investment portfolio?\n\nWith all the hype surrounding bitcoin, it’s understandable if you’re tempted to buy in. But there’s a lot you need to know first before you try to profit off the volatile price.\n\nLearn more: Your guide to start investing in 2025\n\nBitcoin is still a speculative asset\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are speculative investments, which are assets that people put money into, hoping the price will rise rapidly. Sometimes, speculative assets are called nonproductive assets because they don’t generate any income, like interest, dividends, or earnings. Investors who buy speculative assets are typically seeking to profit off short-term price fluctuations.\n\n“Normally, the way you think about a financial asset is you’re providing capital to the company,” said Michael Finke, a professor of wealth management who holds the Frank M. Engle Distinguished Chair in Economic Security at The American College of Financial Services. “The company uses that capital to make something, and the people buy it. That creates profit. You can value the company based on the profitability you expect in the future. With bitcoin, it’s not producing anything, so the valuation is entirely speculative.”\n\nCryptocurrencies don’t earn dividends\n\nThat may not seem like a big deal if you’ve been watching the price of bitcoin tick higher and higher over time. Who needs dividends or interest given that bitcoin’s price has surged more than 600% in the past five years?\n\nYou might think that the price of bitcoin can keep going up forever. After all, the stock market has a solid track record of rising over long periods of time. But keep in mind that, unlike a company whose stock you might buy, bitcoin isn’t creating a product or service that people actually use. Even as a payment method, its usage is extremely limited.\n\nLearn more: Nvidia's market value is up 195% over 11 months. Is it still a good time to invest?\n\nAlso, much of the wealth historically generated by the stock market has come from reinvestment rather than rising stock prices. As dividends get reinvested — which usually happens automatically in most 401(k)s and many automated brokerage accounts — you’re buying more shares, allowing your money to compound and earn even more over time.\n\nAbout 69% of the S&P 500 index’s total return between 1960 and 2022 came from dividends rather than price gains, according to research by Hartford Funds. Put another way, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 in 1960 would have been worth more than $4 million by the end of 2022. But without dividend reinvestment and compounding, the same investment would have only been worth about $641,000.\n\nSince bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies don’t earn dividends, any returns you earn will have to come from price appreciation alone.\n\n“People tend to get attracted to things that have gone up recently,” Finke said. “And that’s attractive to anybody who’s investing, but particularly those who tend to be more sentiment-driven investors. They see the price go up and they think they want to be part of it. There’s always that fear of missing out.”\n\nBitcoin’s price remains highly volatile\n\nBitcoin is far more volatile than the overall stock market. That can be exciting when the price is on a tear, like the one we’ve seen in recent months.\n\nBut when times are bad, bitcoin’s price often takes a much harder fall compared to stocks. Take 2022, which was generally an awful year for stocks, with the S&P 500 plunging around 19%. In the same year, bitcoin lost over 60% of its value.\n\nEdelman stresses that bitcoin is highly speculative, with a history of volatility, but he believes its potential makes it appropriate for a long-term portfolio, provided that investors limit it to 1% to 5%.\n\n“The risks are high, and if it fails, a low single-digit allocation won’t cause material harm,” he said. “And thanks to the potential for outsized returns, a small allocation can have a big impact on your overall investment returns.”\n\nLearn more: How does Nvidia make money?\n\nBitcoin is not the diversifier it used to be\n\nStill, one common reason for investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is for portfolio diversification. Spreading risk across multiple asset classes can reduce your overall risk of major losses.\n\nThe relationship between stock and cryptocurrency prices has long been debated. But recent research suggests that stock and bitcoin prices are becoming more correlated, which means they’re increasingly moving in the same direction.\n\nA 2023 working paper by the International Monetary Fund states that bitcoin and stock prices “are fairly uncorrelated before 2020, then increasingly correlated from the second half of 2020.” One potential explanation is that institutional investors are more likely to have exposure to both bitcoin and stocks.\n\nResearchers at Georgetown University noted a growing correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500, particularly in times of crisis. The paper states that the correlation “significantly increased during COVID, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the crypto winter, indicating that Bitcoin failed to serve as a hedging asset during these events.”\n\nBitcoin probably isn’t coming to your 401(k)\n\nDon’t expect your 401(k) administrator to start offering bitcoin anytime soon. Fidelity and a smaller administrator called FORUSALL have both been offering employers the option to let plan participants invest a small portion of their retirement money in cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Finke doesn’t expect plans will make crypto widely available to employees, even with the new bitcoin ETFs. Plan sponsors have a fiduciary duty, meaning they’re obligated to act in participants’ best interests. One of those responsibilities is to minimize the risk of substantial losses.\n\n“Plan sponsors are very cautious and their consultants are very cautious about adding investment options to the core menu of a plan,” Finke said.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. Department of Labor has warned 401(k) plan administrators to exercise caution before offering crypto assets in their retirement plans, noting in a March 2022 memo that it can be “extraordinarily difficult, even for expert investors, to evaluate these assets and separate the facts from the hype.”\n\nLearn more: How much can you contribute to your 401(k) in 2025?\n\nSo, should you invest in bitcoin?\n\nUltimately, investing in bitcoin is a personal decision, whether you’re buying ETFs or actual digital coins. If you decide to invest, you should have an already diversified portfolio of assets like index funds. You typically don’t want to invest money in speculative assets you can’t afford to lose.\n\nBefore you buy bitcoin, think about what’s motivating you: Do you believe bitcoin has potential long-term investment value? Or is it a case of FOMO, or fear of missing out?\n\n“Investors who get attracted to shiny things because they’ve gone up in value a lot recently tend to get consistently punished,” Finke said. “This recent run-up in bitcoin seems like a perfect example of a shiny object that has attracted a lot of attention from investors but may not really perform that well in the future.”"

(NYSE:T) provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide. It will report its Q4 2024 earnings on Jan. 22, 2025. Wall Street analysts expect the telecommunications giant to post an EPS of $0.49, down from $0.54 in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $32.10 billion, up from $32.02 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nThe 52-week range of AT&T's stock price was $15.94 to $24.03.\n\nAT&T’s dividend yield is 4.68%. During the last 12 months, it paid $1.11 per share in dividends.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Latest On AT&T\n\nOn Oct. 23, the company announced its Q3 2024 earnings, posting operating revenues of $30.21 billion, down 0.5% year-over-year and marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $30.44 billion, as reported by Benzinga. Adjusted EPS of $0.60 beat the estimate of $0.57.\n\nAT&T reiterated wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range, broadband revenue growth of 7%+ and adjusted EPS of $2.15 –$2.25 versus the consensus of $2.20. It maintained full-year adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range and full-year free cash flow of $17 billion –$18 billion.\n\nCheck out this article by Benzinga for 10 top analysts' insights on AT&T.\n\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nHow Can You Earn $100 Per Month As A AT&T Investor?\n\nIf you want to make $100 per month –$1,200 annually – from AT&T dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $25,641, which is around 1,090 shares at $23.53 each.\n\nUnderstanding the dividend yield calculations: When estimating, you need two key variables – the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (4.68% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0468 = $25,641 to generate an income of $100 per month.\n\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price.\n\nThe dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis."
