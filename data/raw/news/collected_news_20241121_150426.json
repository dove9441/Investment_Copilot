      "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought.\n\nAstronomers know that the universe is being pushed apart at an accelerating rate and they have puzzled for decades over what could possibly be speeding everything up. They theorize that a powerful, constant force is at play, one that fits nicely with the main mathematical model that describes how the universe behaves. But they can’t see it and they don’t know where it comes from, so they call it dark energy.\n\nIt is so vast it is thought to make up nearly 70% of the universe — while ordinary matter like all the stars and planets and people make up just 5%.\n\nBut findings published earlier this year by an international research collaboration of more than 900 scientists from around the globe yielded a major surprise. As the scientists analyzed how galaxies move they found that the force pushing or pulling them around did not seem to be constant. And the same group published a new, broader set of analyses Tuesday that yielded a similar answer.\n\n“I did not think that such a result would happen in my lifetime,” said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist at the University of Texas at Dallas who is part of the collaboration.\n\nWhat is the DESI collaboration?\n\nThe Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) making observations in the night sky on the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory located about 56 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Tucson in the Tohono O’odham Nation. (Peter Toman Tomas Slovinsky/NSF’s NOIRLab via AP)\n\nCalled the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, it uses a telescope southwest of Tucson, Arizona to create a three-dimensional map of the universe over 11 billion years to see how galaxies have clustered throughout time and across space. That gives scientists information about how the universe evolved, and where it might be heading.\n\nThe map they are building would not make sense if dark energy were a constant force, as it is theorized. Instead, the energy appears to be changing or weakening over time. If that is indeed the case, it would upend astronomers’ standard cosmological model. It could mean that dark energy is very different than what scientists thought — or that there may be something else altogether going on.\n\n“It’s a time of great excitement, and also some head-scratching and confusion,” said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is not involved with the research.\n\nThe collaboration’s latest finding points to a possible explanation from an older theory: that across billions of years of cosmic history, the universe expanded and galaxies clustered as Einstein’s general relativity predicted.\n\nIs dark energy dead?\n\nThe new findings aren’t definitive. Astronomers say they need more data to overturn a theory that seemed to fit together so well. They hope observations from other telescopes and new analyses of the new data over the next few years will determine whether the current view of dark energy stands or falls.\n\n“The significance of this result right now is tantalizing,” said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmouth College who is not involved with the research, “but it’s not like a gold-plated measurement.”\n\nWhy does dark energy matter?\n\nThere’s a lot riding on the answer. Because dark energy is the biggest component of the universe, its behavior determines the universe’s fate, explained David Spergel, an astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation. If dark energy is constant, the universe will continue to expand, forever getting colder and emptier. If it’s growing in strength, the universe will expand so speedily that it’ll destroy itself in what astronomers call the Big Rip.\n\n“Not to panic. If this is what’s going on, it won’t happen for billions of years,” he said. “But we’d like to know about it.”\n\n——\n\nThis story was first published on Nov. 19, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 20, 2024 to correct the location of the telescope used by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. It is southwest of Tucson, Arizona, not in Tucson. It also corrects the description of the instrument’s three-dimensional map of the universe. The telescope mapped how the universe evolved over 11 billion years, but the universe is about 13.7 billion years old.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Mary Conlon reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

      "full_content": "HONG KONG (AP) — Forty-five ex-lawmakers and activists were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison Tuesday in Hong Kong’s biggest national security case under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement.\n\nThey were prosecuted under the 2020 national security law for their roles in an unofficial primary election. Prosecutors said their aim was to paralyze Hong Kong’s government and force the city’s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately.\n\nThe unofficial primary held in July 2020 drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official election. Authorities postponed the official legislative election, however, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLegal scholar Benny Tai, whom the judges called the mastermind, received the longest sentence of 10 years. The judges said the sentences had been reduced for defendants who said they were unaware the plan was unlawful.\n\nHowever, the court said the penalties were not reduced for Tai and former lawmaker Alvin Yeung because they are lawyers who were “absolutely adamant in pushing for the implementation of the Scheme.”\n\nFILE - A supporter holds a placard with the photos of some of the 47 pro-democracy defendants outside a court in Hong Kong, on July 8, 2021. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)\n\nIn the judgment posted online, the judges wrote that Tai essentially “advocated for a revolution” by publishing a series of articles over several months that traced his thinking, even though in a letter seeking a shorter sentence Tai said the steps were “never intended to be used as blueprint for any political action.”\n\nTwo of the 47 original defendants were acquitted earlier this year. The rest either pleaded guilty or were found guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion. The judges said in their verdict that the activists’ plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis.\n\nThe judges rejected the reasoning from some defendants that the scheme would never have materialized, stating that “all the participants had put in every endeavor to make it a success.”\n\nThe judges highlighted that a great deal of time, resources and money were devoted to the organization of the primary election.\n\n“When the Primary Election took place on the 10 and 11 July, no one had remotely mentioned the fact that Primary Election was no more than an academic exercise and that the Scheme was absolutely unattainable,” the judgment read. “In order to succeed, the organizers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyze a government.”\n\nSome of the defendants waved at their relatives in the courtroom after they were sentenced.\n\nGwyneth Ho, a journalist-turned-activist who was jailed for seven years, said onFacebook that “our true crime for Beijing is that we were not content with playing along in manipulated elections.”\n\n“We dared to confront the regime with the question: Will democracy ever be possible within such a structure? The answer was a complete crackdown on all fronts of society,” she wrote.\n\nChan Po-ying, the wife of defendant Leung Kwok-hung, told reporters she wasn’t shocked when she learned her husband received a jail term of six years and nine months. She said they were trying to use some of the rights granted by the city’s mini-constitution to pressure those who are in power to address the will of the people.\n\n“This is an unjust imprisonment. They shouldn’t be kept in jail for one day,” said Chan, also the chair of the League of Social Democrats, one of the city’s remaining pro-democracy parties.\n\nEmilia Wong, the girlfriend of Ventus Lau, said his jail term was within her expectations. She said the sentencing was a “middle phase” of history and she could not see the end point at this moment, but she pledged to support Lau as best she could.\n\nPhilip Bowring, the husband of Claudia Mo, was relieved that the sentences were finally handed down.\n\nObservers said the trial illustrated how authorities suppressed dissent following huge anti-government protests in 2019, alongside media crackdowns and reduced public choice in elections. The drastic changes reflect how Beijing’s promise to retain the former British colony’s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to China in 1997 is increasingly threadbare, they said.\n\nBeijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city’s stability.\n\nThe sentencing drew criticism from foreign governments and human rights organizations.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong said the U.S. strongly condemned the sentences for the 45 pro-democracy advocates and former lawmakers.\n\n“The defendants were aggressively prosecuted and jailed for peacefully participating in normal political activity protected under Hong Kong’s Basic Law,” the statement said, referring to the city’s mini-constitution.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters no one should be allowed to use democracy as a pretext to engage in unlawful activities and escape justice.\n\nHong Kong Secretary for Security Chris Tang said in a news briefing that the sentences showed those committing national security crimes must be severely punished.\n\nThe subversion case involved pro-democracy activists across the spectrum. They include Tai, former student leader Joshua Wong and former lawmakers. Wong was sentenced to four years and eight months in jail. He shouted “I love Hong Kong, bye bye!” before leaving the courtroom. Young activist Owen Chow was given the second-longest jail term, seven years and nine months.\n\nMost of them have already been detained for more than three and a half years before the sentencing. The separations pained them and their families.\n\nMore than 200 people stood in line in rain and winds Tuesday morning for a seat in the court, including one of the acquitted defendants, Lee Yue-shun. Lee said he hoped members of the public would show they care about the court case.\n\nPeople wait outside the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts in Hong Kong Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, ahead of the sentencing in national security case.

(AP Photo/Chan Long Hei)\n\n“The public’s interpretation and understanding has a far-reaching impact on our society’s future development,” he said.\n\nWei Siu-lik, a friend of convicted activist Clarisse Yeung, said she arrived at 4 a.m. even though her leg was injured. “I wanted to let them know there are still many coming here for them,” she said.\n\nThirty-one of the activists entered guilty pleas and had better chances of getting reduced sentences. The law authorizes a range of sentences depending on the seriousness of the offense and the defendant’s role in it, from under three years for the least serious to 10 years to life for people convicted of “grave” offenses."

      "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped billionaire professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon to be secretary of the Education Department, tasked with overseeing an agency Trump has promised to dismantle. He also selected Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former television talk show host and heart surgeon, to head the agency that oversees health insurance programs for millions of older, poor and disabled Americans, and named Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department.\n\nMcMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump’s initial term from 2017 to 2019 and twice ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut.\n\nMcMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009 and has spent years on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. She’s seen as a relative unknown in education circles, though she has expressed support for charter schools and school choice.\n\n“Linda will use her decades of Leadership experience, and deep understanding of both Education and Business, to empower the next Generation of American Students and Workers, and make America Number One in Education in the World,” Trump said in a statement.\n\nIn nominating McMahon, Trump is rewarding a loyal backer of his movement who, along with Lutnick, has also helped lead his transition team. She was with him Tuesday as he attended a launch of SpaceX’s Starship craft in Texas.\n\nWhat to know about Trump’s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nAfter her time in the Trump administration, McMahon became the chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank created by Trump supporters and former officials who have been preparing for his return to government. McMahon has also been chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC.\n\nShe is married to Vince McMahon, who stepped down as World Wrestling Entertainment’s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that he engaged in sexual battery and trafficking. He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of TKO Group Holdings this January, though he has denied the allegations.\n\nIf confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, Linda McMahon will be asked to bring the nation’s schools and universities in line with Trump’s vision of education. Trump has made sweeping promises centered on removing what he sees as “left-wing indoctrination” in America’s schools.\n\nTrump has vowed to cut federal money for “any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.” He has promised to fight university diversity initiatives, saying he will open civil rights investigations and fine colleges “up to the entire amount of their endowment.”\n\nOz, who ran a failed 2022 bid to represent Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate, has been an outspoken supporter of Trump and in recent days expressed support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination for the nation’s top health agency, the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“Dr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention, so we get the best results in the World for every dollar we spend on Healthcare in our Great Country,” Trump said in a statement. “He will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.”\n\nAs the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Oz would report to Kennedy.\n\n“Americans need better research on healthy lifestyle choices from unbiased scientists, and @robertfkennedyjr can help as HHS secretary,” Oz said in an Instagram post last week.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Oz would be responsible for the programs — Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act — that more than half the country relies on for health insurance.\n\nMedicaid provides nearly-free health care coverage to millions of the poorest children and adults in the U.S., while Medicare gives older Americans and the disabled access to health insurance. The Affordable Care Act is the Obama-era program that offers health insurance plans to millions of Americans who do not qualify for government-assisted health insurance, but do not get insurance through their employer.\n\nTrump has said he wants to overhaul the Affordable Care Act but has said he only has “concepts of a plan” for how that redesign would operate. During his first term in office, he tried unsuccessfully to scrap the program altogether. Last month, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson promised that health care reform would be a big part of Trump’s second term agenda.\n\nDuring his campaign for senate, Oz promised to expand Medicare Advantage, the privately run version of Medicare that has become increasingly popular but also a source of widespread fraud.\n\nTV personality Oprah Winfrey helped launch Oz into fandom and fortune. After years of appearing on her show as a health expert, Oz landed a talk show of his own that aired for 13 seasons. Oz has been accused of hawking dubious medical treatments and products on his defunct TV show. And during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, he pressured government officials to make hydroxychloroquine widely available, despite unresolved questions about its safety and effectiveness.\n\nHe estimated his net worth to be between $100 million and $315 million, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed in 2022.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the chamber’s president pro tempore, said Tuesday in a statement that Oz, who has described himself as “strongly pro-life,” was unqualified for the position.\n\n“Dr. Oz has zero qualifications, pushes alarming pseudoscience, & holds extreme anti-abortion views,” she said in a post on X. “CMS is a critical agency & we need serious leaders to protect Americans’ health care and bring down costs — not TV hosts whose main qualification is their loyalty to Trump.”\n\nLutnick, meanwhile, will have a key role in carrying out Trump’s plan to raise and enforce tariffs as commerce secretary, Trump said. Lutnick is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nTrump made the announcement on his social media platform, Truth Social. He said Lutnick “will lead our Tariff and Trade agenda, with additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.”\n\nThe nomination would put Lutnick in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.\n\nAn advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that “tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use — we need to protect the American worker.” Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China — and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.\n\nMainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.\n\nLutnick had been considered for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.\n\nLutnick joined Cantor Fitzgerald in 1983 and rose through the ranks to be appointed president and CEO in 1991. He also chairs financial technology company BGC Group Inc. and the commercial real estate services firm Newmark Group Inc.\n\nLutnick has donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and once appeared on Trump’s NBC reality show, “The Apprentice.” He has become a part of the president-elect’s inner circle, and has shared the stage with Trump at events in the closing days of his campaign, including a rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\n__ Associated Press writer Matthew Perrone in Washington contributed."

      "full_content": "CHICAGO (AP) — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told customers at a conference in Chicago on Tuesday that the company is teaching a new set of artificial intelligence tools how to “act on our behalf across our work and life.”\n\nAI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI “agents” that can do more useful things on people’s behalf. But the cost of building and running AI tools is so high that more investors are questioning whether the technology’s promise is overblown.\n\nMicrosoft said last month that it’s preparing for a world where “every organization will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous.”\n\nMicrosoft elaborated in a blog post Tuesday that such autonomous agents “can operate around the clock to review and approve customer returns or go over shipping invoices to help businesses avoid costly supply-chain errors.”\n\nMicrosoft’s annual Ignite conference caters to its big business customers. The pivot toward so-called “agentic AI” comes as some users are seeing limits to the large language models behind chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s own Copilot. Those systems work by predicting the most plausible next word in a sentence and are good at certain writing-based work tasks.\n\nBut tech companies have been working to build AI tools that are better at longer-range planning and reasoning so they can access the web or control computers and perform tasks on their own on a user’s behalf.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff has criticized Microsoft’s pivot. Salesforce also has its “Agentforce” service that uses AI in sales, marketing and other tasks.\n\n“Microsoft rebranding Copilot as ‘agents’? That’s panic mode,” Benioff said in a social media post last month. He went on to claim that Microsoft’s flagship AI assistant, called Copilot, is “a flop” that is inaccurate and spills corporate data."

In his announcement, Trump said Lutnick, the chief executive of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, would spearhead the administration's \"tariff and trade agenda\". Lutnick had also been in the running for treasury secretary, a more high-profile role. Trump has yet to make a decision about that closely watched post, which has sweeping authority in areas such as economic and tax policy.\n\nThe fight over whom to pick has spilled into public view. Over the weekend, billionaire Elon Musk promoted Lutnick for the position and criticised one of the alternative candidates, Scott Bessent, as too \"business as usual\". Lutnick, a self-described \"strong capitalist\", has praised Trump for offering a \"competitive growth model\". During the campaign, he served as a spokesman for some of Trump's most controversial plans, including wide-ranging tariffs and the elimination of the income tax. His embrace of those views put him out of step with some on Wall Street, which has historically seen tariffs as bad for corporate America. Commerce is smaller than the treasury department, with a workforce of about 50,000 people. It is a key player in areas where business and national security interests collide, such as restricting technology exports to China or enacting tariffs to protect US steel. The department is also heavily involved in government efforts to boost domestic manufacturing and US companies. Beyond its role in the US-China trade and tech war, its responsibilities include patent approvals, publishing economic data, and conducting the US census. In the announcement, Trump called Lutnick a \"dynamic force on Wall Street for more than 30 years\" and praised his transition work finding people to help staff the new administration. He said Lutnick would also have special responsibility for the office of the US Trade Representative, which is not officially part of the Commerce department.\n\nWho is Howard Lutnick?"

      "full_content": "Los Angeles CNN —\n\nLos Angeles officials on Tuesday moved to cement the city and its schools as sanctuaries for immigrants and LGBTQ youth as the city positions itself to push back strongly against President-elect Donald Trump’s platforms on immigration and gender.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council, which represents the second-largest US city, unanimously voted to adopt a “sanctuary city” ordinance that prohibits city resources from being used in immigration enforcement or to cooperate with federal immigration agents, unless required by state law.\n\nThe ordinance is expected to be approved by Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Los Angeles Unified School District passed a handful of emergency resolutions intended to thwart the incoming Republican administration, including protections for immigrant families and staff, enforcement of “respectful” treatment of LGBTQ community members and preparations to resist some policies in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president.\n\nCity officials are racing to implement the measures before Trump retakes the White House in January, when the president has vowed to enact strict border and immigration policies on Day 1. LGBTQ advocates also fear his presidency will result in wider restrictions on transgender people and rollbacks of protections for other LGBTQ groups.\n\n“We know what’s coming. They’ve said what’s coming, and we want to tell our students and their families and all of our personnel that you are welcome here,” school board President Jackie Goldberg said Tuesday.\n\nIn the days after Trump’s election, Bass and City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto expedited the release of the sanctuary ordinance to the city council after hearing a flood of concerns from immigration groups.\n\n“Especially in the face of growing threats to the immigrant communities here in Los Angeles, I stand with the people of this city,” Bass said in a statement last week. “This moment demands urgency. Immigrant protections make our communities stronger and our city better.”\n\nCalifornia’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is also reigniting his resistance campaign against Trump, calling last week for lawmakers to convene a special session to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration.\n\nThe city ordinance legally enshrines several city policies that are already in place to protect migrants, including a decades-old Los Angeles Police Department mandate that officers not inquire about a person’s immigration status or make arrests based on a person’s immigration status.\n\nBut it also likely sets the city up for conflict with the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed large-scale detention and deportation of migrants – especially those who are undocumented.\n\nTom Homan, a former Trump-era Immigration and Customs Enforcement director whom Trump has tapped to be his administration’s “border czar,” has expressed disdain for sanctuary cities.\n\nLos Angeles City Council members listen as a man speaks in support of a proposed \"sanctuary city\" ordinance at City Hall on Tuesday. Etienne Laurent/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with “Fox & Friends” last week, Homan suggested the Trump administration may try to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and federal agents will not be deterred from enforcing migration policies.\n\n“If sanctuary cities don’t want to help us, then get the hell out of the way. Because we’re coming,” Homan said.\n\nCouncil member Curren Price Jr., however, insisted Tuesday the sanctuary status will be essential to maintaining trust between the city and immigrant communities, some of which may refrain from reporting crimes or seeking emergency assistance out of fear they could be deported.\n\n“Sanctuary cities are not just a legal framework,” Price said. “They represent a moral commitment to upholding human dignity, protecting families and ensuring that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, can live without fear.”\n\nProtections for school students and staff\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified school board passed several motions Tuesday to strengthen its position as a sanctuary for district families and staff members who may be threatened by Trump administration policies, notably migrant families and LGBTQ students.\n\nThe board unanimously approved a motion to reaffirm its sanctuary policy, which bars school personnel from voluntarily cooperating with immigration enforcement or sharing information about the immigration status of students and families with immigration agencies.\n\nTeachers and administrators will receive training on how to respond to federal immigration personnel who request information about students and families or who are trying to enter school property.\n\nGoldberg, the board president, also said the district will “aggressively oppose” any effort to create federal laws that require school districts to comply with immigration enforcement actions.\n\nIn an effort to create a more accepting environment for LGBTQ students and staff, the district approved another motion to expand its rules about “respectful treatment of all persons” to include gender identity and gender expression.\n\nThe resolution cited the “nationwide proliferation of anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and narratives,” which “exacerbates discrimination, invalidates people’s humanity, and stokes fear and anxiety.”\n\nPromise to resist Project 2025 policies\n\nThe school board in its final vote issued a direct rebuke of Project 2025, which has called for a complete overhaul of federal education policy and eventual elimination of the Department of Education.\n\nIn its motion, the board resolved to “protect and defend students, families, and staff from the harm intended by Project 2025,” though the board did not elaborate on specific project policies beyond the abolition of the Department of Education.\n\nBoard member Rocío Rivas called the move a “bold and necessary shield against the looming threats to public education.”\n\n“LAUSD stands as a beacon on inclusivity, a safe harbor for all, and this resolution fiercely declares that we will not cower in the face of those who seek to undermine the very foundation of our diverse and vibrant community,” Rivas said.\n\nThough Trump has sought to distance himself publicly from Project 2025, a CNN review found that at least 140 people who worked in the first Trump administration were involved in it. He has even tapped some of its contributors for his incoming administration, including his pick for Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr.\n\nTrump also repeatedly called for the elimination of the Department of Education on the campaign trail.\n\n“We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education,” he said in September at a rally in Wisconsin. He added: “We will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s youth with all sorts of things that you don’t want to have our youth hearing.”\n\nWithin 60 days of the school board’s resolution, the district superintendent is expected to present a detailed plan on how the district will “defend public education and the students, families, and staff we serve” from policies detailed in Project 2025 and similar Trump administration actions."

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has named his transition co-chair Linda McMahon as his pick to serve as the next secretary of the Department of Education.\n\nThe decision, which Trump announced Tuesday night confirming CNN’s earlier reporting, took shape after it became clear that McMahon would be passed over for Commerce secretary. Trump named his other transition co-chair, Howard Lutnick, as his pick to lead the Commerce Department earlier Tuesday after the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO had thrown his name into the mix for Treasury secretary, sparking a battle with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent.\n\n“Linda will use her decades of Leadership experience, and deep understanding of both Education and Business, to empower the next Generation of American Students and Workers, and make America Number One in Education in the World. We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort,” Trump said in a statement.\n\nMcMahon, a major Republican donor and a former pro-wrestling executive, served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term. She was appointed in 2017 and resigned in 2019 to become the chair of America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nShe is the board chair of the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank that was formed in 2021 by McMahon, Larry Kudlow and other advisers from the first Trump administration.\n\nAFPI has raised millions of dollars since it was founded and has been described as a “White-House-in-waiting,” planning potential policy proposals for Trump’s second term.\n\nTrump’s education secretary could potentially be tasked with overseeing the department’s demise after the president-elect repeatedly called for abolishing the agency on the campaign trail.\n\nIt would be difficult to get rid of the entire department, which delivers federal funding to nearly every public K-12 school in the country and manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. And shutting it down would require an act of Congress.\n\nIt may be more likely that some programs are moved to other federal agencies. The overarching goal for many Republicans is to reduce the federal government’s role in local education, which could be achieved by retaining funding programs but delivering money to states and schools with fewer strings attached.\n\nUnder the new education secretary, the department may use the formal regulatory process to undo changes the Biden administration made to Title IX that sought to expand protections for LGBTQ+ students. A new rule could potentially say that Title IX prevents trans students from playing on girls’ sports teams, something Trump campaigned on.\n\nMcMahon is also the former CEO of the WWE, which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. As head of the WWE, Linda McMahon oversaw its transformation from a small wrestling entertainment company into a publicly traded media empire. She stepped down as CEO in 2009.\n\nMcMahon twice ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in Connecticut, losing in 2010 and 2012. She self-funded those campaigns, spending $50.1 million in 2010 and $48.7 million in 2012, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign financing. Trump donated $5,000 to her campaign in 2012.\n\nMcMahon herself is a major Republican donor. During Trump’s first campaign for president, McMahon donated more than $7 million to two pro-Trump super PACs, according to Open Secrets.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Kate Sullivan and Katie Lobosco contributed to this report."

      "full_content": "correction A previous version of this article misattributed a quote to Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-California). The quote is actually from Rep. Robert Garcia (D-California). This story has been corrected. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) has introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from female bathrooms in the Capitol, two weeks after Democrat Sarah McBride of Delaware became the first openly trans person elected to Congress. While McBride has not joined Congress yet — she will be among the freshman class of House members to be sworn in Jan. 3 — Mace’s resolution would amend House rules to block McBride and any other trans person visiting the Capitol from using bathrooms associated with their gender identity.\n\nThe resolution does not specifically name McBride, but Mace said Tuesday that “it’s 100 percent because of McBride” and that the future congresswoman “doesn’t get a say” in shaping the first-of-its-kind policy.\n\n“This is about women and our right to privacy, our right to safety,” Mace said of the measure that she introduced Monday. “I’m not going to allow biological men into women’s private spaces. It is the height of hypocrisy.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcBride declined to answer questions on the matter while leaving a House Democratic caucus meeting Tuesday. She did respond to Mace’s resolution shortly after it was filed Monday night, saying in a post on X: “Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness.”\n\n“This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,” McBride added. “We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.”\n\nThe newly ignited debate is forcing the House to grapple with an unprecedented issue: how to address transgender individuals in the Capitol complex without infringing on their rights. The Republican Party campaigned on targeting transgender individuals; President-elect Donald Trump’s closing argument focused on the issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) addressed the issue during House Republicans’ weekly conference meeting Tuesday morning, telling reporters after the discussion that the House is “going to resolve the issue.”\n\n“It’s an issue of first impression for the Congress,” he said. “This is an unprecedented matter, so we’re going to, we’ll find a resolution that solves the problem.”\n\nJohnson at the news conference refused to say whether he thinks McBride is a woman or a man, and he said House Republicans welcome “all new members with open arms.” He vowed to build “consensus” around Mace’s push and said the House will “accommodate the needs of every single person.”\n\n“I believe it’s a command we treat all persons with dignity and respect,” he said. “I’m not going to engage in silly debates about this.”\n\nHours later, Johnson sought to clarify his position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Let me be unequivocally clear: A man is a man, and a woman is a woman, and a man cannot become a woman,” Johnson said. “But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity, and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.”\n\nMace said she spoke to the speaker about the resolution Monday and that Johnson would consider adding it into the rules package that dictates how the House floor and complex operate during the 119th Congress. She said that if Johnson did not ultimately include it, she would file a privileged resolution next year that would force a vote on the matter within 48 hours of its introduction in the new Congress.\n\nAfter Johnson spoke about his position Tuesday, Mace promised to file another bill on the issue, but declined to tell reporters what that measure would include.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe House votes to approve the rules Jan. 3, shortly after members are sworn in to office by the newly elected speaker of the House. The rules are typically adopted on party lines, and a majority of Republicans will have to support it, given their thin majority and Democrats’ refusal to help approve controversial conservative provisions.\n\nQuestioned about the issue, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma), who recently chaired the House Rules Committee, said Tuesday that he was “not going to get involved in bathroom debates.”\n\nCurrently, Mace’s resolution is not privileged, meaning the House does not have to immediately vote on it. Even if the resolution were to be adopted this year, it would have to be reintroduced and passed in 2025 to be in effect for the 119th Congress.\n\nEarlier this month, McBride made history when Delaware elected her to succeed Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D), who is now headed to the Senate. In her victory speech, McBride, a 34-year-old state senator, said America’s democracy “is big enough for all of us.” Her rise marks a consequential moment for the country’s trans community, and it comes amid escalating violence against trans people and efforts by state legislatures to limit their rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublican lawmakers nationwide — in both statehouses and the U.S. Capitol — have pushed to limit trans rights, and fights over bathroom access have broken out across the country. Conservative lawmakers in virtually every state have introduced additional measures to restrict gender transition care or block trans girls from participating in sports.\n\nAs she left the House Republican conference meeting Tuesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) said the men in the GOP conference — including Johnson — should “be defending” GOP women who want to ban trans individuals from bathrooms. “America is fed up with the trans ideology being shoved into our face. Men are not women,” Greene said.\n\nWhile Greene has repeatedly misgendered McBride and used her birth name while speaking about Mace’s resolution — a move anti-trans individuals use to attack trans people — Mace referred to McBride with her chosen pronouns of “she” and “her” and used her chosen name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Democrats have quickly come to McBride’s defense.\n\n“She just got to Congress. She’s going to use whatever restroom she needs to use. It’s just sad that we have to have this conversation,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-California) said.\n\nRep. Becca Balint (D-Vermont) wrote on X: “There’s no bottom to the cruelty. We have an obligation to push back. When we allow attacks on someone’s basic human dignity, we’re all made more cruel.”\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-Massachusetts) told reporters that it wasn’t a “great start” for the new Republican House majority to kick off the 119th Congress by talking about “where one member out of 435” is going to use the bathroom.\n\n“The American people say: Mind your own business about where people do their business,” Clark said. She argued that what voters do want Republicans to talk about is the economy, housing and child care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMace appears to have shifted on the issue. In 2021 — before her district was redrawn to be more GOP-friendly — Mace supported a Republican alternative to the Equality Act called the “Fairness for All Act.” In defending her choice to back the bill, Mace said at the time that she “strongly” supports “LGBTQ rights and equality.”\n\n“No one should be discriminated against,” she said then.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mace cited those credentials as the reason she is pushing to bar McBride from using the women’s bathrooms on Capitol Hill.\n\n“This puts women in harm’s way, especially women who are survivors of abuse. Just the idea of a man going into a woman’s private space, it feels like rape. It’s just not okay,” Mace said.\n\nAfter overhearing Mace, Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Illinois), the first openly gay member of Congress from Illinois, told reporters that her stance is “absolutely ignorant.” He said he is confident that some Republican members who are supportive of LGBTQ rights would stand against Mace’s effort.\n\n“There’s no statistic anywhere that shows that any trans person commits any crimes at any higher rates than anyone else, so I don’t know where her worry is from,\" Sorensen said."

      "full_content": "CNN —\n\nEuropean officials are looking toward Russia after two submarine internet cables in the Baltic Sea were suddenly disrupted in an apparent sabotage operation, just weeks after the United States warned that Moscow was likely to target critical undersea infrastructure.\n\nA cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday, according to Telia Lithuania, the telecommunications company that runs the link. Separately, the state-controlled Finnish telecoms company Cinia said one of its cables, which connects Finland and Germany, was disrupted on Monday.\n\nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority said Tuesday that the country’s National Unit against International and Organized Crime had opened a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage over the cut cables. Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation also said it had launched an investigation.\n\nWhile the exact causes of the incidents are still being investigated, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he believed it was likely sabotage.\n\n”Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed,” he told reporters on Tuesday morning ahead of a ministerial meeting in Brussels, Belgium. “We have to know that, without knowing specifically who it came from, that it is a hybrid action and we also have to assume that, without knowing by whom yet, that this is sabotage,“ Pistorius said.\n\nHis comments came after the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement on Monday evening that they were “deeply concerned” about the severed cable between their nations, and raised the possibility of the incident being part of a “hybrid warfare.”\n\n“The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway,” the statement continued. “Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.”\n\nHowever, two US officials familiar with an initial assessment told CNN Tuesday that as yet there were “no indications of nefarious activity, nor intentional damage to seafloor infrastructure” and suggested the disruption was likely caused by an anchor dragged from a passing vessel.\n\nTracking data from Kpler and Spire did not show any ships near the area where the cables are believed to have been cut. All vessels above a certain tonnage are required by international law to have automatic identification systems that allow them to be tracked, and must keep them on at all times.\n\nThere are some instances where these might be turned off, and military ships are not required to have it turned on. Vessels that have it turned off are frequently involved in illicit operations such as oil smuggling and illegal fishing.\n\nHowever, ship tracking data analyzed by CNN shows at least one ship crossing the Lithuania-Sweden cable.\n\nThe cutting of the cables on Sunday and Monday fits the pattern of attacks that have been linked to Russia. Additionally, it is no secret that Russia has been showing increased interest in undersea cables in recent months, patrolling close to critical maritime infrastructure often far from its shores.\n\nTwo US officials told CNN in September that the United States believed Russia was now more likely to carry out potential sabotage operations.\n\nThey said Moscow has been beefing up its dedicated secretive marine unit that deploys fleets of surface ships, submarines and naval drones to survey the seabed.\n\nKnown as “GUGI,” the Russian acronym for the “General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research,” the unit was previously spotted lurking around critical infrastructure.\n\nA joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found in April 2023 that Russia had deployed a fleet of suspected spy ships in Nordic waters as part of a program of potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region.\n\nHybrid warfare\n\nEuropean security officials and experts have been warning for months that Russia was waging a hybrid war against the West – accusations prompted by a series of seemingly random arson attacks, hackings and explosions that occurred across multiple European cities in recent months.\n\nThese included arson attacks against a bus garage in the Czech capital of Prague, the Museum of Occupation in Riga, Latvia, a warehouse of a Ukrainian company in London and a shopping center in Warsaw, Poland. Multiple hacking attacks and spying incidents have also been reported in different European countries. As the same time, the European Union has accused Russia and Belarus of weaponizing migration by pushing asylum seekers from third countries to its borders.\n\nRod Thornton, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King’s College London, said that Moscow has been using sabotage as an alternative to a full-on war with NATO, which would be disastrous for Russia.\n\nInstead, Russia is trying to cause disruption without crossing the threshold that would trigger a forceful response from NATO. The principle that an attack against one member country is an attack against the whole alliance is the cornerstone of the group’s defense pact.\n\nThornton said it was telling that the disruption happened at the time Russia is trying to increase pressure on Ukraine and the West.\n\n“It could be seen as Russia ramping up the war and the effects of the war in Ukraine before (US President-elect Donald) Trump comes into power to increase the willingness of Western powers to bring an end to the war,” he told CNN in an interview.\n\n“You can see how Trump wants to bring an end to the war, and if the Russians increase pressure on other Western countries and show them the effects of the war, then those Western countries might be more amenable to supporting Trump in his desire to have a ceasefire,” he explained.\n\nNobody has so far claimed responsibility for the damage. If Russia was behind it, it is unlikely to admit so.\n\nAll of the sabotage attacks that have been linked to Russia earlier this year had one thing in common: they were done in a way that allowed Moscow to deny any involvement, usually by low-level operatives or common criminals paid to conduct them.\n\n“This is important because international institutions like the UN can’t blame Russia because the evidence isn’t there. The circumstantial evidence is there, but not the real evidence, there’s no actual kind of smoking gun that can be linked back to them,” Thornton said.\n\nOleksandr V. Danylyuk, an associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a UK defense and security think tank, and a former Ukrainian defense and foreign intelligence official, said this kind of deniability has long been Russia’s strategy.\n\n“The idea is to conduct the operation in the way that everybody understands that it was done by Russia, but at the same time, it leaves some room for the victim to pretend they didn’t know, because the victim is not interested in escalation,” he said, also pointing to the events leading to the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014.\n\n“Those little green men, everybody knew that they were Russian forces, but because the West wasn’t ready, you know, to do anything, they could say ‘oh, it’s not certain, we should check what’s going on, maybe it’s some kind of local militia,’” he said.\n\nLimited disruption\n\nThe extent of the disruption, if any, caused by the damage to the cables is unclear. Accidents that cause damage to undersea cables are rare, but they do happen, so most providers run services through several different routes to avoid blackouts.\n\nThe limited disruption could have been intentional, making the impact serious enough to be seen as an escalation, but not enough to spiral out of control, for now.\n\n“It does take it that that one stage further, but it’s cutting a cable that isn’t going to offend too many countries. They could have gone to the Atlantic and cut a cable there between the US and the UK, or between Europe and the US, which could have major, major consequences, so this is a kind of warning shot,” Thornton said.\n\nCinia said in a statement that services running through the C-Lion1 cable that connects Helsinki with Rostock were down, but added that Finland’s international telecommunication connections were routed via multiple links.\n\nThe company said a repair vessel had been dispatched to the scene and, while it did not yet know how long it would take to fix the issue, added that it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables to be repaired.\n\nTelia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius was quoted by Lithuanian media as saying that the cable that was disrupted – BCS East-West – handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. He added that traffic has been restored since the disruption."

      "full_content": "An unusually powerful force is fueling weather hazards in the northwestern United States and Canada, including an intense atmospheric river headed to California. The record-strong low-pressure system is developing offshore of Oregon and Washington, causing low air pressure that is more typical of a major hurricane. On Tuesday evening, a buoy off the coast of Washington, near the storm’s center, was reporting an air pressure of 950 millibars with wind gusts of 74 mph. Although the center of the storm will remain offshore, winds were forecast to intensify along the Oregon and Washington coastline through Tuesday evening.\n\nAmong the multiple hazards that will last into the weekend, an atmospheric river of moisture will extend some 2,000 miles across the Pacific, from Hawaii to Northern California, where it made landfall on Tuesday night. It is expected to deliver 10 to 20 inches of rain to California’s northern Coast Ranges and very heavy snow to the Klamath Mountains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeavy rain, mountain snow and strong, potentially damaging winds will affect Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. Snow will also extend into Idaho, Montana, Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nWhy is this atmospheric river unusual?\n\nAtmospheric rivers are long, relatively narrow, concentrated plumes of water vapor that transport heat and moisture out of the tropics and toward the poles.\n\nThese rivers in the sky are ranked based on their level of moisture transport and duration. The one that made landfall in Northern California on Tuesday night was forecast to qualify as a Category 4 (out of 5), strong atmospheric river — most notable for its long duration.\n\nBut what’s most unusual about this atmospheric river is the intense low that’s driving it.\n\nOn Tuesday, a low-pressure system off the Northwest coast strengthened so rapidly that it qualified as a meteorological bomb. This happens when a storm’s central pressure drops by more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, although the intensification rate needed depends on latitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis storm was forecast to deepen from around 984 millibars Tuesday morning to 943 millibars in the evening, easily becoming a bomb cyclone in half the time required to qualify.\n\nThe image below shows the location of the storm during what was expected to be its peak intensity Tuesday night, denoted by the purple shading offshore Washington state.\n\nRecord-breaking low pressure, more typical of a major hurricane\n\nAn analysis of atmospheric pressure dating back to the 1940s shows that this should be the most intense November storm on record in the region by about 15 millibars. The intensity of the storm, according to its minimum central air pressure, is consistent with that of a Category 4 hurricane — which speaks to the ferocious nature of its expected impacts.\n\nThe image below shows the areas, shaded blue, where the storm is forecast to break air pressure records for November.\n\nWhat’s causing this intensity?\n\nThe storm will deepen as a very loopy jet stream is forced to flow around a strong ridge of high pressure centered over the Bering Sea before taking a big dip southward off the Northwest coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis pattern is occurring on the backdrop of a North Pacific marine heat wave, which has contributed to unusual jet stream patterns this fall. Marine heat waves are expected to become more common amid a warming world.\n\nThe slow-moving storm’s intensity is expected to be reinforced when a secondary low-pressure system strengthens offshore from late Thursday into Friday, causing another surge of drenching rainfall and heavy mountain snow.\n\nA blizzard warning is in effect for the Cascade Mountains of Washington above elevations of 2,500 feet, where total snowfall may exceed a foot with winds gusting to 60 mph. Similarly heavy snowfall is forecast across the border in British Columbia, such as across the Vancouver Island Ranges and in the mountains to the east of Vancouver.\n\nThe animation below shows the atmospheric river as it flows into the region from Tuesday night through Friday.\n\nThe rain and snow should turn less intense across the region over the weekend before giving way to a drier pattern next week."

      "full_content": "New York CNN —\n\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones has sued a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee and the families of some of the Sandy Hook victims in an attempt to stop the sale of his media empire Infowars to the satirical news outlet The Onion.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Jones claimed trustee Christopher Murray and the families “colluded” for a “flagrantly non-compliant Frankenstein bid” and asked a judge to halt the sale.\n\nThe parent company of Infowars was auctioned off last week as part of bankruptcy proceedings to help pay some of the nearly $1.5 billion Jones owes the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre for defamation.\n\nAccording to court documents, The Onion, via its parent company Global Tetrahedron, offered $1.75 million in cash along with a “credit” from the Connecticut families, who offered to forgo 100% of their portion of the winning bid to support the effort.\n\nThe one other competing bid, at $3.5 million, came from First United American Companies, which is affiliated with Jones and operates his lucrative online nutritional supplements store.\n\nBut The Onion, according to a copy of its bid filed as evidence by Jones, said their bid should be valued at closer to $7 million considering the families’ credit. Jones’ attorneys argued that The Onion’s math to reach such a figure is “nonsense.”\n\nJones’ suit also claimed his defamation verdict will be overturned on appeal.\n\nA spokesperson for The Onion declined to comment. A spokesperson for the families did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJones’ lawsuit comes after First United American Companies also filed an emergency motion to stop the sale. In response to those complaints, Murray, who had discretion to choose the winning bidder, wrote that First United American Companies was a “disappointed bidder.”\n\n“The Trustee intends to respond in due course fully and in detail to the barrage of baseless allegations, selective quoting and half-truths in FUAC’s recent filings,” Murray wrote to the court Monday.\n\nOne of the issues, attorneys for First United American Companies said in court last week, was that the trustee changed the format of the auction to a best and final written offer instead of holding a live auction. First United American Companies said that it was not made aware of the winning bid amount and did not have the opportunity to increase its offer.\n\nFederal bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, who is overseeing the case, harshly questioned an attorney for the trustee about the auction rules.\n\n“I am not comfortable with the process and the highest level of transparency that took place,” Lopez said during a hearing Thursday, adding the court will hold an evidentiary hearing to fully understand what took place.\n\nMurray, the trustee, said during the hearing that the auction process involved a round “where people could submit sealed bids” for the specific Infowars assets they were interested in. Then, “under the auction procedures, when those come in, we evaluate that and then decide how to proceed to if we do it all the next auction, the order is very clear that there doesn’t even have to be another auction.”\n\nAn attorney for The Onion’s parent Global Tetrahedron said they were only privy to as much information about the auction process as the other bidders and were somewhat surprised that there was not a live auction.\n\nWhile Lopez said that he expected to hold an evidentiary hearing on the auction process sometime early this week, a hearing has yet to be scheduled. The next hearing on the docket is scheduled for November 25."

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead\n\nSocial media minnow Bluesky has emerged as a surprise winner in the wake of this month’s presidential race. People are flocking there almost as fast as they’re fleeing X, driven by distaste for owner Elon Musk’s cozy ties with President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe influx has triggered a wave of hot takes and deep dives on Bluesky. Here’s the real story behind what’s fact, what’s fiction and why this social network is suddenly in vogue.\n\nJack Dorsey is Bluesky’s link to X\n\nThis is somewhat true. The platform was initially a project Dorsey started while he was then-Twitter’s CEO in 2019, when he chose Jay Graber to be Bluesky’s CEO. But Dorsey left his role at Twitter in November 2021, before the platform was incorporated as an independent company in February 2022. As a result of new management (then-CTO Parag Agrawal became Twitter’s CEO), Twitter decided to sever its agreement with Bluesky, meaning the platform was a completely separate entity which relied on funding rounds for money rather than Twitter’s purse.\n\nAs for Jack Dorsey? He cut ties with Bluesky completely in May, after stepping down from his board role and deleting his account.\n\nBluesky is just another X alternative\n\nWhile the platform resembles X’s interface, the way it operates is fundamentally different. That’s down to its decentralized nature (the platform is built on the AT Protocol — an open, decentralized network), which allows users more control over their data and content. How so? Because user data isn’t stored on centralized servers the way they are on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, for example.\n\n“Our open social network returns choice to users, gives developers the freedom to build, and gives creators independence from platforms,” Bluesky’s Emily Liu told Digiday.\n\nBluesky is giving Threads and X a run for their money\n\nIf you believed the headlines, you might think that’s the case. But it’s not quite true. Sure, users might be leaving X, saying they’re heading over to Bluesky, but the platform still has a way to go to compete.\n\nLiu told Digiday that Bluesky has already reached 19.8 million users, about a million new users per day over the past few days.\n\n“The majority of new users this week are coming from the U.S., U.K., and Canada, though our top three countries on the network are the U.S., Japan, and Brazil,” she said.\n\nTo compare, Meta’s Adam Mosseri posted that Threads had passed the 275 million user mark on Nov. 3, while the last recorded user figures for X was 570 million monthly active users.\n\n“The single greatest hurdle to clear is the attraction and retention of influential users from across the cultural spectrum,” said Christopher Spong, associate director, social media at Collective Measures. “X, and Twitter before it, was a communications cornerstone where the perspectives of world leaders, athletes, celebrities, and journalists could be found. Drawing in these entities, or enough of them, will be essential to Bluesky’s survival.”\n\nDecentralized platforms have no control over moderation\n\nSome assume decentralization leads to chaos. But Bluesky offers robust moderation tools and user-driven content control, distinguishing it from platforms like Mastodon, which sits on another decentralized network called ActivityPub.\n\nJosh Rosen, president of Hotspex Media highlighted that Bluesky is currently developing tools which aim to tackle the challenge of users creating multiple accounts to harass others, as well as reducing the number of spam accounts by disabling them within seconds of receiving a report. “As more users join, we’ll get to see the full effectiveness of these moderation attempts,” he added.\n\nDecentralization means no accountability\n\nSome assume decentralization leads to less accountability, but Bluesky employs community-driven moderation and transparency through its open-source AT Protocol. Simply put, the platform’s approach focuses on automated filtering, manual admin actions, and community labeling, while its server operators can set rules on what content they will host.\n\nBut as Grace Harmon, analyst / writer of tech and AI briefings at eMarketer suggested, relying on volunteer moderators can be risky.\n\n“Since Bluesky is still establishing its public identity, this is a moment where faulty content filters or a proliferation of inappropriate content or spam posts might push Bluesky users away before they ever get hooked,” she said.\n\nBluesky is just for tech enthusiasts\n\nWhile initially attracting a tech-savvy audience, Bluesky’s user-friendly interface and features like custom feeds and moderation tools make it accessible to a broader audience.\n\n“We’ve heard from users that they’re receiving incredibly high levels of engagement from real people, and that most importantly, they’re having fun again,” said Liu.\n\nIt still lacks features compared to X\n\nGiven Bluesky is only about two years old, and X (including its Twitter years) is 18, it will naturally seem more basic, simply because Bluesky is in its infancy. But that doesn’t mean the platform isn’t already rolling out features to appeal to a wide userbase.\n\nIn fact, Bluesky’s team posted a product roadmap on its blog back in May, which said that over the next few months (without providing specific timelines or dates), they’ll be focusing on a lot of “quality of life” improvements and some long-requested features. These include:\n\nDMs (which has since been added)\n\nVideo (version one will allow clips up to 90 seconds long)\n\nImproved custom feeds\n\nImproved anti-harassment features\n\nOAuth (a “log in” with Bluesky button)\n\nThe platform is achieving instant success without challenges\n\nAlthough Bluesky has gained traction, it faces challenges like ensuring effective moderation and maintaining its unique community vibe as it grows.\n\n“If the company can sustain this growth and appropriately keep up the features that are drawing users in, it could set itself up as the go-to alternative for people feeling alienated by X’s brand safety issues or frustrated by Threads’ upcoming ad launch,” said Harmon.\n\nBluesky is set to introduce advertising\n\nCurrently, the platform doesn’t take advertising. Back in February, CEO Jay Graber reaffirmed this position during an interview with Wired, when she said “There will always be free options, and we can’t enshittify the network with ads.” Simply put, they can’t bring on a bunch of ad revenue and subsequently lower the quality of the user experience by doing so, because it’s counterproductive.\n\nStill, that doesn’t mean Bluesky won’t entertain ad revenue in the future. Platforms are known to publicly state they won’t start advertising initially. But after reaching a certain level of users, advertising becomes inevitable. Threads is a case in point, after the team initially said they’d focus on the user experience, it was reported earlier this month that ads are already expected in the early part of 2025 — albeit this date is already a push back from the H2 2024 timeline that was floated past some industry execs Digiday spoke to back in April.\n\nBut ads or no ads, some advertisers are already asking about Bluesky. Take Tinuiti, for example. Jack Johnston, the agency’s senior social innovation director said the conversation around Bluesky with their clients has become significantly more active since the election.\n\n“With no formal advertising right now, most of the conversations are exploratory,” he said. “That way, if Bluesky starts asking for ad dollars in the future, they already understand the difference between ads on Bluesky, Threads and X and what that future looks like.”\n\nBluesky is the next big platform success story\n\nSure, it’s had a lot of hype and headlines since the election, but that should be taken with a pinch of salt. Is it good that Bluesky’s userbase is growing? Course. Does that automatically mean the platform is here to stay? Not necessarily. Think Clubhouse, Post., Pebble (formerly T2) — all these platforms set out to be the next big thing, but for one reason or another, none of them survived.\n\nAll that is to say, it’s going to take a lot more than a few weeks of user growth to prove Bluesky is here to stay."

      "full_content": "Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook posted the 200th triple-double of his career on Tuesday night in a win over Memphis.\n\nThe NBA recordholder for triple-doubles reached the milestone late in a 122-110 victory.\n\nThe 36-year-old Westbrook finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists, and it took him until the final minutes to accomplish the feat.\n\nWith 1:28 left, Westbrook was one rebound shy of the triple-double when center Dario Saric missed a 3-pointer. Westbrook grabbed his only offensive rebound of the game. With the Grizzlies still threatening, Saric knocked down a 3-pointer with 27.7 seconds left to preserve the Denver win.\n\nWestbrook said he wasn’t thanking Saric for the miss that led to the triple-double.\n\n“I thank him for making the next one to close the game, which is the most important,” he said.\n\nAfter the game, Westbrook received the game ball and celebrated the feat with his teammates.\n\nWestbrook is 19 triple-doubles ahead of Oscar Robertson, and 62 in front of Magic Johnson. Teammate Nikola Jokić is fourth with 136, followed by LeBron James at 117. Of the players who rank in the top 10 in career triple-doubles, four players — Robertson, Johnson, Jason Kidd and Wilt Chamberlain — are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nCareer triple-doubles Rank Player Triple-doubles 1.

But I’m also appreciative of the ones who came before me.”\n\nWestbrook’s teammates marveled at his accomplishment, not only the number of triple-doubles but also his longevity and ability to achieve such an accomplishment.\n\nJulian Strawther, the second-year guard out of Gonzaga, said Westbrook is a celebrity everywhere they go.\n\n“It’s hard to put into words,” Strawther said. “Two hundred triple-doubles is a lot. I don’t even know if I’ve got 200 career games.”\n\nFor Westbrook, the feat capped an ideal night.\n\n“Anytime we win and I get them, I’m always grateful for that,” Westbrook said. “It’s my favorite time.”\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

      "full_content": "The third edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings were released Tuesday night with undefeated Oregon holding at No. 1 in the initial year of the expanded 12-team field. Off to a dominant start this season with wins over Ohio State, Michigan, Illinois, and most recently, Wisconsin, the Ducks sit in the top spot seeking to make their second playoff appearance overall -- first since the four-team field debuted after the 2014 season.\n\nSeven of 10 teams ranked No. 1 in a season's initial CFP Rankings ultimately reached the playoff in the four-team era with Mississippi State (2014), Tennessee (2022) and Ohio State (2023) being the exceptions. With eight more spots in the field this season, Oregon sits in a strong position at 11-0 as one of two remaining Power Four undefeated programs this season (Indiana).\n\nOhio State, Texas, Penn State and Indiana round out the rest of the top five -- as they did last week. The most notable change came with Georgia reentering the projected 12-team playoff field coming off its dominant win over Tennessee last Saturday.\n\nThe top Group of Five program in Tuesday's release is Boise State at No. 12. With the 12-team playoff model granting automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions, the Broncos stand in pole position to earn that opportunity should they win their league. Other Group of Five teams in this week's rankings are Army West Point (19), Tulane (20) and UNLV (24).\n\nLet's take a look at the entire CFP Rankings top 25 along with the projected bracket seedings for the first 12 teams. Check out analysis by bowls expert Jerry Palm below.\n\nCollege Football Playoff Rankings, Nov. 19\n\nAnalysis by bowl expert Jerry Palm\n\nWhen breaking down the College Football Playoff bracket based on this week's CFP Rankings, the folks in Boise, Idaho, are doing the most celebrating. The Broncos only moved up one spot in the rankings this week to No. 12, but what's of more importance is that all of the Big 12 teams in the rankings are behind them. So if the playoff started today, Boise State would get a bye.\n\nHowever, the Broncos' seeding could be up for debate.\n\nWhile Miami is ranked higher than SMU in the CFP Rankings, the Mustangs currently sit alone atop the ACC standings. Taking that into account and using SMU as the ACC champion at the present time means Boise State would get a bye as the projected 3-seed, not the 4-seed. Miami would still be in as an at-large team, but there would be no room at the inn for Georgia or Tennessee.\n\nHere's how the bracket would look when taking those changes into consideration:\n\n(9) Alabama at (8) Notre Dame -- Winner plays (1) Oregon\n\n(12) BYU at (5) Ohio State -- Winner plays (4) SMU\n\n(11) Ole Miss at (6) Penn State -- Winners plays (3) Boise State\n\n(10) Miami at (7) Indiana -- Winner plays (2) Texas\n\nBoise State cannot get too comfortable, though. The Broncos have just as good of a chance of being jumped from behind as having teams drop below them. There are no games left on their schedule against ranked teams unless UNLV can wedge its way into the Mountain West Championship Game.\n\nWhen it came to the ordering of the two-loss SEC teams, I surmised that the committee would go with strength of schedule, but they decided to still honor the one head-to-head result that has not been canceled out: Ole Miss' victory over Georgia. The Bulldogs are still ahead of Tennessee as well. The Volunteers' win over Alabama is the only one among that group of four teams that is not honored, but it was impossible to account for all of them.\n\nAnother head-to-head result that is no longer carrying the day is BYU's win at SMU. The Cougars fell eight spots to No. 14, which is the largest drop of the week for a team that is still in the rankings and one spot below the Mustangs.\n\nOne oddity this week in the top 10 is that Alabama, coming off that big, resume-building win over Mercer, jumped Miami, which must have looked sloppy in practice on their bye week. Another one further down saw No. 23 Missouri hold its position from last week despite losing at South Carolina.\n\nThe top seven spots are unchanged, but that will not be the case next week after Indiana visits Ohio State.\n\nNew to the rankings this week are Arizona State, Iowa State, UNLV and Illinois. We say goodbye, for now, to Kansas State, Louisville, LSU and Washington State.\n\nOf course, there are still a few weeks left in the season, and there will surely be more changes as we get additional games between some of these teams fighting for College Football Playoff contention."

      "full_content": "NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin thinks the fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was a ruse and claimed a clause in the contract prevented the Internet personality from getting hit.\n\nOn the latest episode of It Is What It Is, the three-time Super Bowl champion gave his thoughts on the highly-publicized fight that ended with Paul defeating Tyson by unanimous decision. According to Irvin, the whole fight was one big lie because there was a clause in the contract that said Tyson couldn't go all out.\n\n\"They had no intentions to really scrap at all,\" said Irvin. \"If you look through that, I didn't see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What if Mike Tyson hit him with an uppercut? Then I heard some people talking about they put that in the contract. He couldn't body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?\"\n\nHe continued, \"You got all these people out here, and he couldn't body him and do that patented uppercut. All of that is Mike Tyson is not Mike Tyson anyway, and now you taking away Mike Tyson's best gift, which was that uppercut. Man, that's a big lie to me. That's like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out. You do what you do best. If they take that away you not that dude anymore, and they took that away.\"\n\nDJ Whoo Kid said he heard something similar regarding the fight contract. According to Whoo Kid, both fighters could legally not hit each other. If Tyson were to fully connect with Paul.\n\nJudges ruled in favor of Paul with a score of 80-72, 79-73, and 79-73. According to the scorecard, Tyson landed 18 punches out of 97 and Paul had 78 out of 278, an odd stat for the former heavyweight champion.\n\nDuring the post-fight press conference, Paul revealed that he had held back from using his full power as he didn't want to hurt Tyson any more than he had already done.\n\n\"I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn't want hurt someone who didn't need to be hurt,\" said Paul before adding he didn't feel Tyson's power. \"I didn't wanna hurt someone that didn't need to be hurt.\""

The vulnerabilities were reported by security researchers at Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed hacking and cyberattacks, suggesting that a government actor may be involved in the attacks. Government-backed cyberattacks sometimes involve the use of commercial phone spyware.\n\nAs for the bugs themselves, Apple said the vulnerabilities relate to WebKit and JavaScriptCore, the web engines that power the Safari browser and for running web content. WebKit is a frequent target of malicious hackers, who target the engine for vulnerabilities as a way to break into the device’s wider software and tap into the user’s private data.\n\nThe security advisory says the bugs can be exploited by tricking vulnerable Apple devices into processing maliciously crafted web content, such as a website or email, to trigger arbitrary code execution, which can allow the planting of malware on a target’s device.\n\nUsers should update their iPhones, iPads, and Macs as soon as possible.\n\nApple did not comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Tuesday."

Credit: SpaceX/Blue Origin\n\nNASA, along with its industry and international partners, is preparing for sustained exploration of the lunar surface with the Artemis campaign to advance science and discovery for the benefit of all. As part of that effort, NASA intends to award Blue Origin and SpaceX additional work under their existing contracts to develop landers that will deliver large pieces of equipment and infrastructure to the lunar surface.\n\nNASA expects to assign demonstration missions to current human landing system providers, SpaceX and Blue Origin, to mature designs of their large cargo landers following successful design certification reviews. The assignment of these missions builds on the 2023 request by NASA for the two companies to develop cargo versions of their crewed human landing systems, now in development for Artemis III, Artemis IV, and Artemis V.\n\n“NASA is planning for both crewed missions and future services missions to the Moon beyond Artemis V,” said Stephen D. Creech, assistant deputy associate administrator for technical, Moon to Mars Program Office. “The Artemis campaign is a collaborative effort with international and industry partners. Having two lunar lander providers with different approaches for crew and cargo landing capability provides mission flexibility while ensuring a regular cadence of Moon landings for continued discovery and scientific opportunity.”\n\nNASA plans for at least two delivery missions with large cargo. The agency intends for SpaceX’s Starship cargo lander to deliver a pressurized rover, currently in development by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), to the lunar surface no earlier than fiscal year 2032 in support of Artemis VII and later missions. The agency expects Blue Origin to deliver a lunar surface habitat no earlier than fiscal year 2033.\n\n“Based on current design and development progress for both crew and cargo landers and the Artemis mission schedules for the crew lander versions, NASA assigned a pressurized rover mission for SpaceX and a lunar habitat delivery for Blue Origin,” said Lisa Watson-Morgan, program manager, Human Landing System, at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “These large cargo lander demonstration missions aim to optimize our NASA and industry technical expertise, resources, and funding as we prepare for the future of deep space exploration.”\n\nSpaceX will continue cargo lander development and prepare for the Starship cargo mission under Option B of the NextSTEP Appendix H contract. Blue Origin will conduct its cargo lander work and demonstration mission under NextSTEP Appendix P. NASA expects to issue an initial request for proposals to both companies in early 2025.\n\nWith the Artemis campaign, NASA will explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from home, and prepare for future exploration of Mars. NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, exploration ground systems, and Orion spacecraft, along with commercial human landing systems, next-generation spacesuits, Gateway lunar space station, and future rovers are NASA’s foundation for deep space exploration.\n\nFor more on NASA’s Human Landing System Program, visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/hls\n\n-end-\n\nJames Gannon\n\nHeadquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1600\n\njames.h.gannon@nasa.gov\n\nCorinne Beckinger\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.\n\n256-544-0034\n\ncorinne.m.beckinger@nasa.gov"

      "full_content": "The frozen cub not only provides the first look at what a saber-toothed cat looked like in real life, Reynolds notes, but also represents a life stage that paleontologists know less about, as most fossils are from adult animals.\n\nSeeing a sabertooth fur real\n\nLopatin and his coauthors identified the cub as a baby Homotherium latidens. The carnivore, sometimes called a scimitar-toothed cat for its shorter, serrated canine teeth compared to the “dirk-toothed” Smilodon, was a lanky and wide-ranging predator that was better suited to running after prey than the ambush techniques used by the famous Smilodon. Found in both Eurasia and North America, the cat hunted juvenile mammoths and other megafauna. Fossil sites such as Friesenhahn Cave in Texas indicate that the felines sometimes made dens in caves to raise their cubs.\n\nWithout fossils that preserve soft tissue like fur, muscle, and skin, paleontologists have debated what Homotherium would have looked like. For example, illustrators have often depicted sabertooths with the tips of their canines sticking out below their muzzles, which may have been true for some species like Smilodon. But a 2022 analysis suggested that Homotherium had deep muzzles, where the cat’s sabers were “concealed weapons” covered by the upper lip when the mouth was closed.\n\nEven with the mummy, the question of whether Homotherium adults had covered fangs is challenging. Lopatin notes that the upper lip of the cub is more than twice as deep as that of a modern lion cub, further hinting that Homotherium had lips capable of concealing the long canine teeth that they would later grow. Reynolds cautions, however, that the cub did not have its adult teeth yet. Only a mummy of an adult Homotherium can settle that debate. The “saberkitten” suggests that an adult Homotherium mummy could be awaiting discovery, as well.\n\nIn other respects, the cub’s anatomy confirms what paleontologists expected from bones. “The cub had the enlarged neck muscles thought to occur in adults, and also had long, muscular forelimbs seen in adult Homotherium,” says Margaret Lewis, a paleontologist at Stockton University in New Jersey who was not involved in the new study. The juvenile’s jaw was also capable of wide gapes that adult Homotherium used to bite into prey, she notes."

      "full_content": "Well ahead of its usual schedule, Google has just released the first preview of Android 16. This initial developer preview isn’t meant for the general user, but it’s freely available to anyone who wishes to try it. Here’s what Google Pixel devices can install the Android 16 Developer Preview and how to install it.\n\nWhy is the Android 16 Developer Preview available so early?\n\nGoogle usually releases the first preview of its annual Android release in the first few months of each year, so why is the first Android 16 Developer Preview launching in November?\n\nThis is because Google has shifted its schedule, at least for Android 16, to move up the launch considerably. Google has confirmed that Android 16’s initial launch will take place in Q2 2025, a few months ahead of schedule. A minor SDK update, like a “.1” release, will then launch towards the end of 2025.\n\nWhat Pixel devices are compatible with Android 16?\n\nGoogle has an industry-leading software commitment on its most recent Pixel releases, but Android 16 hints that it plans to push the envelope on older devices as well. While no devices from before Google’s “Tensor reboot” are eligible for Android 16’s first preview, the Pixel 6 series remains supported.\n\nThe full list of Pixel devices compatible with the first Android 16 Developer Preview is as follows:\n\nPixel 6\n\nPixel 6 Pro\n\nPixel 6a\n\nPixel 7\n\nPixel 7 Pro\n\nPixel 7a\n\nPixel Tablet\n\nPixel Fold\n\nPixel 8\n\nPixel 8 Pro\n\nPixel 8a\n\nPixel 9\n\nPixel 9 Pro\n\nPixel 9 Pro XL\n\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nAll devices on this list should be getting the full Android 16 update in 2025 when it’s officially released.\n\nShould I install the Android 16 Developer Preview?\n\nRealistically, most people shouldn’t install a developer preview.\n\nThis initial release of Android 16 is designed for developers to test their apps on the updated OS version. New features may be live, but most things won’t be, and the experience will likely be fairly unstable. IF you do install, toggle the ability to unlock your bootloader first. It can be a horrible mistake if you don’t. Unless you’ve got a second Pixel kicking around to test it out, you should just wait for the Android 16 Beta program.\n\nSpeaking of…\n\nWhen does the Android 16 Beta start?\n\nGoogle typically releases 2-3 developer previews in the lead up to a new version of Android. For Android 16, there will be two developer previews released in November and December.\n\nThen, in January, the first of at least four beta releases will arrive ahead of a final release sometime after that.\n\nAndroid 15 launched for Pixel phones in October, but hit AOSP in September. Looking at Google’s updated timeline, Android 16 is likely to see its final release as early as April, but at the very latest in June. Google says that it expects platform stability by March 2025 with “several months before the official release.”\n\nHow to install the Android 16 Developer Preview on Pixel\n\nDuring the developer preview stage, you can only install Android 16 builds on Pixel devices.\n\nThe update requires that you first install the Android 16 Developer Preview 1 build manually via a Factory Image. The Android Beta Program, used for installing beta builds, is not available for Developer Preview builds.\n\nIf you are not familiar with sideloading updates manually, we strongly encourage you to wait for the final release. But if you just can’t wait to get your hands on the latest and greatest, here’s how to manually install it.\n\nInstall Android 16 using the Android Flash Tool\n\nThe “easy” option is to use the Android Flash Tool.\n\nThis browser-based tool allows you to sideload factory images from one place. To get started, go to flash.android.com/preview/baklava-dp1. You’ll be prompted to, if you haven’t already, install the Android USB driver. Then, just plug in your device, confirm its connection to the Flash Tool, and select the build you want to install, and you’re off to the races!\n\nIf you have not unlocked your bootloader, the tool will walk you through it. But, again, this will reset your device.\n\nHow to manually unlock your bootloader\n\nUnlock your bootloader (manually)\n\nOn Google Pixel, unlocking your bootloader takes a few steps but, before you take any of them, you need to know that this will factory reset your device.\n\nFirstly, you’ll need to enable Developer Options by going to Settings > About phone and tapping on “Build number” repeatedly unless Android asks for your PIN. You can then access Developer Options through Settings > System > Developer options. Scroll down from here slightly and toggle on “OEM unlocking.” You’ll be asked again to confirm your PIN before proceeding.\n\nAgain, this will factory reset your device and delete all data.\n\nYour device will then ask you to confirm you want to unlock the bootloader, which will also require that the device undergoes a complete factory reset. These commands will work with any Google Pixel device compatible with Android 16, and it’s a recommended step for installing the developer preview.\n\nHow to install the Android 16 Developer Preview manually\n\nDownload Android 16 Boot into Recovery Enable ADB sideload Connect to your computer Begin sideloading Reboot\n\nDownload Android 16\n\nTo get started, you’ll first need to download the files needed to actually put Android 16 Developer Preview 1 on your Pixel.\n\nThere are two ways to do so. First, you can install a Factory Image, which wipes your phone and starts everything from scratch. Alternatively, and the way we’ll detail here, there’s an OTA file, which installs over your current version of Android without wiping your phone. Unlike beta builds, though, you should fully reset your device before installing a developer preview, and unlock your bootloader as detailed above.\n\nYou can download the developer preview OTA file from Google. That site contains OTA downloads for sideloading different updates, including the Android 16 Developer Preview, on every Pixel and Nexus device, so you’ll need to scroll down to ensure you are downloading the file that is associated with your device. OTA downloads for Android 16 Developer Preview 1 are provided HERE.\n\nFor the Android 16 Developer Preview 1, only Pixel 6/Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7/Pro, Pixel 7a, Pixel 8/Pro, Pixel 8a, Pixel Fold, Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Pixel Tablet are available.\n\nYou won’t be able to install it on the original Pixel/XL, Pixel 2/XL, Pixel 3/XL, Pixel 3a/XL, Pixel 4/XL, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, Pixel 5, or Pixel 5a.\n\n2. Boot into Recovery mode\n\nNext, you’ll boot your Pixel into Recovery mode. To do this, fully power down your handset. Then hold down on the Power button and the Volume down button at the same time until you get to the Bootloader page. You will know you’re in the right place when you see an Android figure lying down on the screen.\n\nUsing your volume buttons, scroll down to Recovery mode. Select this by clicking the power button. Alternatively, if you’re already connected to a computer with ADB, you can use the reboot recovery command.\n\nNow, you should see a smaller Android lying down with an exclamation mark over it. From here, press the Power button and the Volume up button for about a second to fully enter Recovery mode. Releasing the Volume up button will send you into Recovery.\n\n3. Navigate to ADB sideload\n\nUsing the volume buttons, scroll down to Apply update from ADB and select it with the power button. This will launch a mostly blank screen with text near the bottom directing you on how to sideload an OTA.\n\nThis step is important as it’s the only way to transfer the downloaded OTA file to your handset. You’ll need to have ADB and Fastboot tools in a handy place. You can download ADB tools from the Android Developers website. You can also use the Universal ADB Drivers from ClockWorkMod, which can make the process a bit easier on Windows devices.\n\n5. Enter the sideload command\n\nAs long as everything is in place, you can now sideload the OTA file. On Windows, ensure your Command Prompt is directed to the ADB tools folder and type in adb sideload. If you’re on macOS or Linux, do the same thing in Terminal (use “cd” and “ls” commands to make sure your Terminal is pointed at the right folder – Google it if you need help) but type in ./adb sideload. You’ll then need to insert the file name of the .zip folder you downloaded from Google and hit enter to start the process.\n\nIf everything is working properly, you should see some dialog on your computer and handset that shows the process of the sideload and installation process.\n\n6. Reboot your phone\n\nOnce the OTA is done installing, you will be taken back to Recovery Mode. The last step to jump into the new update is to select the Reboot now option with your power button.\n\nQuestions?

He was not involved in the research.\n\nThis study was particularly helpful in investigating sitting because of its large sample size and the methodology it employed, Diaz said.\n\nResearchers looked at data from nearly 90,000 people who wore an accelerometer for a week and compared their sedentary and active time with later diagnoses of conditions like stroke, heart attack and heart failure in later years, according to the study published Friday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNot only was more sedentary time associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease, but the data was able to show a general guideline for what might count as too much sitting, according to the study.\n\n\"We would really recommend that as many people as possible avoid sitting more than 10.6 hours a day,\" Ajufo said. \"That's not a hard and fast threshold, but we think it's a reasonable first step for guidelines and public health intervention.\"\n\nWhy sitting is so bad\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to the data.\n\nThe data was part of the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that follows people long-term. The sample was largely White and of European ancestry, which means that it doesn't totally represent the U.S. population, Ajufo said.\n\nThe study is also observational, which means that while it can make associations, it can't prove that the sitting was the cause of the heart disease, she added.\n\nIt makes sense that sitting too much of the day would take a toll, however, Diaz said.\n\nMuscles are very important for regulating blood sugar and fat levels in the blood, he added. To do their job well, muscles need movement.\n\n\"Taking movement breaks is a way to give your muscles the stimulation they need to do their jobs, and it doesn't take much,\" Diaz said.\n\nHow to get moving\n\nIf you sit in an office all day and commute to and from work, those 10 and a half hours of sitting can add up quickly.\n\nThe answer may not be to get a standing desk, Diaz said.\n\nWhile standing is certainly not sitting, being still in one place like that doesn't give your muscles the movement they need to efficiently break down sugars and lipids, he said.\n\nA bike or treadmill desk may help, he said. You can also try to see if small meetings can be had over a walk.\n\nThe important thing is to add movement into your day in a way that makes sense for you and your schedule, Diaz added. He recommended getting up and walking for just a few minutes every half hour to hour or when you finish one task before moving to the next.\n\nUnfortunately, the data suggested a good workout at the end of the day won't necessarily undo the problems caused by long bouts of sitting, Ajufo said.\n\n\"Sometimes we think we can completely make up for some of the unhealthy behaviors we have … by going out and going for a run,\" she said. \"What we can say from the findings is that moderate to vigorous physical activity — so that's running, a brisk walk — is not sufficient to neutralize the harmful effects of sitting.\"\n\nBut don't be disheartened about activity. Exercise is still always a good idea and benefits people in so many ways, Diaz said.\n\n\"You're still better off than the person who sat all day then didn't exercise,\" he said."

      "full_content": "The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) today said tests have identified a suspected avian flu infection in a child from Alameda County who had mild upper respiratory symptoms and no known contact with infected animals.\n\nIf confirmed, the case would mark the second avian flu infection in a child in North America from a yet undetermined source. Last week, health officials in Canada reported an H5N1 infection in a previously healthy British Columbia teen who is hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nAlso, if confirmed the California case would mark the second in the United States this year in a person without exposure to sick farm animals. The first was a Missouri patient who tested positive on a respiratory virus panel while hospitalized during the latter part of August. Serologic testing of a household contact showed that person was likely infected by the virus at the same time.\n\nThe illness also comes amid a dramatic uptick in poultry outbreaks in states that are along the Pacific flyway at a time when migratory birds that carry the virus are flying south. Also, California continues to battle the virus at dairy farms in the Central Valley.\n\nLow-level detection on positive test; child recovering\n\nThe positive test showed a low-level detection, which the CDPH said suggests the child wasn't likely infectious. Repeat tests 4 days later were negative for avian flu, and other testing suggests that the child was positive for other respiratory viruses that could be the cause of the child's cold and flu symptoms.\n\nSpecimens have been sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for confirmation testing. If confirmed, the illness would be California’s 27th of the year and its first not linked to sick animals on dairy or poultry farms.\n\nThe child has been treated and is recovering at home.\n\nThe CDPH, local health officials, and the CDC are investigating the source of the child's illness and assessing possible exposure to wild birds. Alameda County, home to Oakland, is in the San Francisco Bay area, and county officials said there are no commercial dairy herds in the county.\n\nThough the child's close family members also had mild respiratory symptoms, tests were negative for avian flu. However, family members tested positive for the other more common respiratory viruses that the child also had.\n\nChild had been in daycare while symptomatic\n\nOther contacts of the child have been notified and offered treatment out of an abundance of caution, the CDPH said. The child had attended daycare while experiencing symptoms and before the avian flu test was conducted.\n\nLocal health officials have notified caregivers and families about health monitoring and the availability of preventive treatment and avian flu testing.\n\nNo human-to-human spread of bird flu has been documented in any country for more than 15 years.\n\nTomas Aragon, MD, DrPH, CDPH director and state public health officer, said, \"It's natural for people to be concerned, and we want to reinforce for parents, caregivers and families that based on the information and data we have, we don't think the child was infectious—and no human-to-human spread of bird flu has been documented in any country for more than 15 years.\""
