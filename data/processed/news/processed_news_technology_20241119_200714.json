      "processed_content": "Half-Life 2‚Äôs 20th Anniversary update has sparked a new concurrent player count record on Steam. Valve‚Äôs influential shooter hit a peak concurrent player count of 64,222 over the weekend after the studio released an upgraded experience with new features alongside a documentary that revealed gameplay of the canceled Episode 3. It helps that Half-Life 2 also went ‚Äòfree to keep‚Äô until today, November 18. Half-Life 2 launched on November 16, 2004, a year after Steam itself. Public records for the game‚Äôs concurrent player count only begin in September 2008, according to SteamDB, so we don‚Äôt know how many played Half-Life 2 at launch 20 years ago. But we do know that at no point since September 2008 has Half-Life 2 been as popular on Steam as it is now. Half-Life 2's previous recorded best was 16,101 in August 2021 after a community event sparked a resurgence of interest. Play IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! üí° Hint To start: ...try asking a question that can be answered with a \"Yes\" or \"No\". 000/250 Ask The anniversary update means Half-Life 2 now includes the complete Episode One and Episode Two expansions along with the base game. They‚Äôre accessible from the main menu, and you automatically advance to the next expansion after completing each one. There‚Äôs also a new Developers Commentary for the Half-Life 2 base game, after Valve got the team back to record three-and-a-half hours of new behind-the-scenes commentary. Perhaps most exciting is integrated Steam Workshop support, which lets players browse, install, and play user-created content for Half-Life 2 without ever leaving the game. Meanwhile, there are bug fixes and new graphics options that let players push the visual fidelity of Half-Life 2 further than was allowed in the original release. All these updates, the documentary and its associated headlines, and the ‚Äòfree to keep‚Äô offer have combined to boost interest in all things Half-Life 2, and send thousands of players into City 17 to fight back against the Combine. The question now is, will Valve finally follow it up with Half-Life 3? Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Showing just how broad the Fortnite (and associated Unreal Editor) platform has become in recent years, players can now include official TMNT assets in their own published islands, leading to all kinds of user-created shenanigans. TMNT Dimensions, for example, is a fan-made roguelike beat them up, boasting persistent upgrades and a lair that can be built out between runs. We're open-minded enough to appreciate this new hotbed of creativity, which will be the catalyst for an entirely new generation of developers; we look forward to telling these young whipper snappers all about RPG Maker someday.",

      "original_description": "Huawei will launch Mate70 flagship smartphone on November 26 to show its ability of making smartphones without using US chips and software.",
      "processed_content": "China‚Äôs Huawei Technologies is set to launch its Mate70 flagship smartphone on November 26, a milestone in its sanctions-induced quest for self-sufficiency from US chips and software. Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei Consumer Business Group, disclosed the launch date of the Mate70 during a Huawei car launch activity on November 15. Chinese media said Huawei will launch four models simultaneously: the Mate70, Mate70 Pro, Mate70 Pro+ and Mate70 RS. The reports said only the premium models would use a new 7-nanometer processor known as the Kirin 9100, which is said to be comparable to Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and 8+ Gen 1 for central processing units (CPU) and graphic processing units (GPU), respectively. The reports said other Mate 70 phones will use the Kirin 9010 processor, which was used in the Mate 40 launched in 2021 and the P70 launched earlier this year. The Kirin 9100 chip is reportedly made by Chinese chipmaker Shanghai Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) using its deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines and N+3 process, while the Kirin 9000S chip used in last year‚Äôs Mate60 is made using SMIC‚Äôs N+2 process. Both the 9100 and 9000S are 7nm chips, but the N+3 process can feature 130 million transistors per square millimeter, compared with 89 million transistors per square millimeter of the N+2 process. As the 9100 processor has a performance close to a 5nm chip, some media refer to it as a 6nm chip. The Information reported in early September that Huawei and SMIC, both sanctioned by the US government, had planned to make 2.5 million chips before releasing the Mate70 for a September product launch but failed to hit that target due to limited manufacturing capacity and unspecified productivity issues. The Mate70 will also use Huawei‚Äôs self-developed HarmonyOS Next operating system, known as ‚Äúpure blood,‚Äù which does not contain Linux codes or support Android applications. The previous versions were based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and Linux kernel. Sanctions target In May 2019, the US Commerce Department added Huawei and its 70 affiliates to its sanctioned Entity List. In August of that year, Google stopped allowing Huawei smartphones to use its Android OS. In September 2020, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the world‚Äôs leading high-end chipmaker, stopped producing Kirin chips, resulting in an inventory countdown for Huawei‚Äôs HiSilicon, the tech giant‚Äôs wholly-owned fabless chipmaker. Yu said in 2019 that the company had a ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù entailing a self-developed chipset and operating system, which after 5.5 years has apparently been accomplished. ‚ÄúAs almost all the core components of the Mate70 are made in China, we can now declare that the US has failed to stop Huawei from making breakthroughs in chips, operating systems and 5G systems,‚Äù a Hunan-based columnist trumpeted in an article in early November. ‚ÄúThe US has completely miscalculated the situation. It thought that Huawei would be seriously hurt by its sanctions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut actually Huawei has become stronger.‚Äù A columnist of 36Kr.com, a Chinese business and IT news website, said HarmonyOS Next could help increase Huawei smartphones‚Äô overall performance by 30% and reduce their power consumption by 20%. However, he opined in terms of hardware Huawei may be lagging behind its competitors, such as Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and Honor, which have significantly improved their products by using high-end US chips and components in the past few years. Moreover, the writer said the Mate70‚Äôs design is not unique as it looks similar to the Mate50 launched in 2022. Sensitive time The Mate70‚Äôs launch is controversial as it comes three weeks after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the US election. Trump has previously vowed to raise tariffs on all Chinese goods to 60% and strengthen America‚Äôs technology blockade against China. In a farewell shot, the Biden administration finalized restrictions on investments by US individuals and companies into China‚Äôs semiconductor, quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors in October. Earlier this month, the US Commerce Department ordered TSMC and Samsung to stop shipping 7nm and below semiconductors to Chinese customers that make AI chips or GPUs. Some commentators projected that Huawei‚Äôs upcoming launch of Mate70 may prompt Washington to further strengthen its technology curbs against China. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last December that the US should continue to tighten its export controls and be more serious about enforcement with its allies as China persistently tries to evade the restrictons.

      "processed_content": "Originally introduced in 2016, it now seems like Apple‚Äôs Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter may soon be discontinued (via MacRumors). Apple started selling this product alongside the iPhone 7, which was the first iPhone to no longer include a 3.5mm headphone jack. If you wanted to use wired headphones (aside from the Lightning EarPods that came in the box), you would need this adapter. Apple included it in the box with the iPhone 7, 8, and X, but starting with the iPhone XS and XR, they stopped including it, requiring customers to buy it separately for $9. Obviously, iPhones use USB-C now, and Apple does still make a USB-C to headphone jack adapter for use with iPhone 15 and later. However, if you use an iPhone 14 or prior, time may be running out. It‚Äôs currently ‚Äúsold out‚Äù on Apple‚Äôs online store, which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean its gone ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a strong sign. As mentioned in MacRumors‚Äô reporting, this same situation played out with Apple‚Äôs USB SuperDrive, where it sold out a few months prior, and then silently got discontinued. While it is out of stock online in the US and in most countries, it is still available in France, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. There‚Äôll likely continue to be MFi options on the market, but if you specifically want the Apple one ‚Äì time is running out. Amazon seems to be out of stock, but you can still buy it from Best Buy, for slightly under the original $9 price tag. Follow Michael: X/Twitter, Threads, Instagram",
      "summary": "Originally introduced in 2016, it now seems like Apple‚Äôs Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter may soon be discontinued (via MacRumors). Apple started selling this product alongside the iPhone 7, which was the first iPhone to no longer include a 3.5mm headphone jack. If you wanted to use wired headphones (aside from the Lightning EarPods that came in the box), you would need this adapter. Apple included it in the box with the iPhone 7, 8, and X, but starting with the iPhone XS and XR, they s...",

It‚Äôs a lot to take in! Luckily, Decrypt‚Äôs GG is all over it. And if you need a quick way to get caught up on the latest moves around crypto video games, we‚Äôre happy to present This Week in Crypto Games. Our weekend roundup serves up the biggest news from the past week, along with a few other tidbits you might have missed. We also showcase a few of our original stories from the week. Biggest news Dogecoin game: Elon Musk‚Äôs favorite meme coin Dogecoin soared last week, and retro-style brawler Super Doginals launched with perfect timing. The game is fully inscribed on the Dogecoin blockchain via the Doginals protocol, which allows people to permanently put artwork, code, and text onto the network. As such, it has been branded as the ‚Äúfirst full-fledged game on Dogecoin.‚Äù It plays similar to classics like Streets of Rage and Fatal Fury, as you control one of three characters‚Äîincluding two anthropomorphic Shiba Inu dogs‚Äîand stroll through side-scrolling environments, pummeling foes based on other meme-friendly creatures like apes, cats, and frogs. Major token date: Telegram gaming and engagement app Major has finally revealed that its hotly anticipated token will launch on The Open Network (TON) on November 28 at 12pm UTC. Players have spent months engaging with the mini app in the hopes of earning a healthy chunk of a future airdrop, which will likely closely follow the token launch. Major is a simple take on the tap-to-earn genre that has dominated Telegram gaming this year. Rather than hiding the genre‚Äôs social tasks behind a thinly veiled clicker game, like other games such as Hamster Kombat have, it pushes this viral mechanic to the forefront‚Äîbecoming more of an engagement machine than a fully-fledged game. Off the Grid hands out cash: On Wednesday, battle royale game Off the Grid announced that it was starting to hand out $3,000 between its top 10 players every day. Leaderboard points are granted for kills, assists, extractions, and match placements. Good enough to finish in first place? You'll have pocketed yourself $1,000. Not bad for a day's work (playing video games). Then on Thursday, the Avalanche-based shooter announced its All-Stars Streamer Invitational tournament with a $600,000 prize pool. Set to go down on Wednesday, November 20, the tournament will see 60 of the top video game streamers fight it out in three-player teams over six matches.

      "processed_content": "Advertisement Siddharth Kashiramka joined Amazon in 2022 as a product manager for AI projects. Looking back, he said his r√©sum√© highlighted his impact, but he wouldn't write in the third person now. He also said he'd stick to one page, the standard recommended r√©sum√© length. Siddharth Kashiramka was six years into his post-master's career when he began considering his next move. He worked as a product manager at Capital One and was previously a consultant at PwC. Some of his colleagues had gone to Amazon, but he didn't want to uproot his life from Virginia to Seattle. Then he was approached about an opportunity to work with artificial intelligence at Amazon ‚Äî no move required. Advertisement To prepare for his interview, Kashiramka networked with contacts who'd made a similar transition, and he spent a month practicing for interviews, doing mock sessions on a career-service platform. After several rounds of interviews, Kashiramka landed a product-management role at Amazon in 2022. The role came with about $300,000 in annual compensation, a mix of base salary and stock options. As a hiring manager, Kashiramka says that while r√©sum√©s are a small part of the overall hiring process, they can still be an important decision-making tool. Advertisement \"I remember an instance where there were two equally good candidates for a position. Both of them cleared the final round of interviews, but the offer had to be given to only one,\" Kashiramka told Business Insider. \"Ultimately, the decision hinged on the candidate with the most polished r√©sum√©.\" Here's the r√©sum√© he used to apply to Amazon and other Big Tech companies. It wasn't perfect ‚Äî he said he'd change three major components. Looking back on the r√©sum√©, Kashiramka said three things worked well: Advertisement 1. Talk about impact: He gave a high-level description of past roles, followed by his work and its impact. 2. Summarize: \"The summary is very unique to me,\" he said. \"You can't copy-paste it to someone else.\" He added that in the future, he'd also add a short section talking about his external mentorship efforts and academic journal contributions, which he has been doing more actively since 2022. 3. Show variety: Throughout the r√©sum√©, Kashiramka used a range of keywords, including \"leveraged,\" \"delivered,\" \"established,\" and \"collaborated.\" He said that \"unintentionally, this also optimizes for the ATS systems as well,\" referring to the application tracking systems that digitally parse r√©sum√©s for keywords. Advertisement What he would change While the r√©sum√© got Kashiramka interviews at Meta, Amazon, and Google, there are still a few things he'd change moving forward: Related stories 1. One-page r√©sum√©: \"I think the r√©sum√© should be one page,\" he said. \"That was a big red flag for me here in this r√©sum√©.\" Kashiramka added that his r√©sum√©s for PwC and Capital One, where he worked before Amazon, were both one page and that he'd return to that length in the future. 2. Use first-person voice: Kashiramka said another mistake was writing about himself in the third person because it sounds less personal. \"It seems very pompous, to be honest,\" he said. \"I'm like: 'Who am I talking about here?'\" Advertisement 3. Attention to detail: \"I have made a few grammatical mistakes in this,\" he said. He recommended using a proofreading tool and getting another set of human eyes on the document. Kashiramka said that while there were grammatical errors, he was careful to be consistent with the formatting, such as not using periods anywhere. Kashiramka is a senior product manager at Amazon's office in Crystal City, Virginia. Business Insider has verified his employment history and compensation.",

      "processed_content": "While the Logitech MX Master 3 is a terrific mouse for the Mac, reports claiming that Apple CEO Tim Cook prefers that mouse over the Magic Mouse are false. The Wall Street Journal last month published an interview with Cook, in which he said he uses every Apple product every day. Soon after, The Verge's Wes Davis attempted to replicate using every Apple product in a single day. During that day, Davis said he mostly used the MX Master 3, but sometimes switched to a Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad. In other words, it was Davis who said he himself used a Logitech mouse, not Cook. Unfortunately, The Mac Observer misinterpreted The Verge's article and ran a since-deleted story claiming that Cook prefers the MX Master 3 over the Magic Mouse. Mistakes happen, but the false claim has since gained traction on Reddit multiple times, so hopefully this helps to clear up the situation before wrong information continues to spread. It would be great if Cook did use the MX Master 3, though. Maybe he would love using a mouse with a front-facing USB-C port so much that he would make the Magic Mouse's port finally not be on the bottom. Hey, we can dream!",
